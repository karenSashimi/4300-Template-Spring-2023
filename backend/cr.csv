Laura Barre,3,3,2,"I took this class with Roger Figueroa, Joanna Fiddler, and Laura Barre. The content of the class is really interesting and useful in everyday life. There are 5 easy in-class assignments, a quiz, and 3 exams. You don't have to go to class and the workload is light, but exams are all multiple choice with really specific questions that you need to memorize off the slides.  ",NS 1150,0
John Michael,3,3,1,"The prelims were unnecessarily hard -- there would be the smallest details that would be asked. However, it was all T/F so i can't really complain. the final exam was really easy though. There was not really much work and everything was basically in class. I would recommend the class if you are truly interested in nutrition.",NS 1150,0
David Levitsky,4,3,2,"Levitsky is a great professor and always tried to make class fun and chill. The term paper is easy as long as you don't procrastinate. Definitely study in advance for the prelims because he covers a lot of material.  Also don't sleep on his extra credit opportunities, they can be really helpful for when you're in between grades.",NS 1150,0
David Levitsky,5,3,2,I think the content is actually really interesting so I enjoyed his class. The lectures were entertaining! But the prelims are weirdly difficult even though it is all t/f.  There is a lot of course content but at least it is interesting.  I really like the prof tho.,NS 1150,0
David Levitsky,4,4,4,"Professor Levitsky is an amazing professor as he is consistently trying to put a smile on his students' faces by his fun demonstrations. He also had the TA's hold review sessions which were extremely helpful in understanding. There is a lot of memorization but if you like the content, it is not boring and if you do well, it is rewarding. There is a research paper at the end, but if you pace yourself throughout the semester, it should not be too bad. All exams are MC/TF and they are long and sort of dreadful, but if you study enough, it is definitely possible to excel!",NS 1150,0
David Levitsky,3,3,3,"This class is pretty straightforward - just stay on top of the lecture content, and you'll be fine. If you leave it all to the last minute, the sheer amount of content will be overwhelming. But if you start studying early and do a bunch of practice tests, the exams should be very straightforward. The professor is really nice, but some of the lectures can be a little dry. The final paper is not very difficult either, just a typical research paper.",NS 1150,0
David Levitsky,4,3,2,"Requirement for DNS majors/lots of HumEc students. David Levitski is super a super engaging and funny guy. He is like 70 and is so passionate about the class and his research. He is also kind of insane though - said some problematic things and his exams were 160 T/F questions. Small assignments, a long research paper, two prelims and a final so not a big workload at all. All lectures were online (even pre covid) but class can be deceptively hard. Reccomend even if you want a taste of nutrition",NS 1150,0

David Levitsky,4,3,3,"Levitsky works to make class engaging and fun, but don't let his humor fool you. Very memorization heavy and the true/false format can be tricky with the wording of questions. Can't wait until the last minute studying with this class. Opportunities to rebuttal are provided though so if you really know the material you can usually get points back. Research paper is not super difficult but it is long, so start early. Extra credit is easily available so take advantage of it.",NS 1150,0
David Levitsky,-,3,-,"Professor Levitsky is amazing! He is super engaging, and the material is really interesting. He records all of his lectures so you can watch them online after class. The tests were not the easiest-they were very long and all questions are True/False. However, there is a lot of opportunity for extra credit! I recommend the class!",NS 1150,0
David Levitsky,-,2,-,"I liked this class. The prof is hilarious. There is a lot of content to memorize but it is interesting and important enough that it isn't too bad. Prelims and exams are all MC/TF and are long, so studying is tedious. Prof cooked in class twice and always had funny vids at the beginning. All lectures are posted on Panapto so you never need to go to class.",NS 1150,0
Pamela Weisberg Shapiro,4,3,3,This class was super straight forward and easy to understand. The class has a lot of case studies which can help balance out your grades if you're not a good test taker. This class is also a good intro to nutrition for anyone who may need to take upper level nutrition classes later on!,NS 1220,1
Tashara Leak,5,4,4,"NS1600 w/ Drs. Leak and Golan was engaging and transformative. Lecture contents include the US healthcare system, mechanisms of disease, the history of public health, and frameworks to building a public health intervention. The course primarily focuses around the final project, which is a written proposal for a hypothetical public health intervention. This is the bulk of the work for the class -- and it's quite a lot, with multiple checkpoints along the way. However, if you really love public health, it's an incredibly valuable experience, and as others have said assignments are extremely intentional. Course staff cares about you &amp; wants you to succeed, but also create an industry-realistic experience. Would heavily recommend esp. to anyone considering public health research. As others have said, office hours are supremely important.",NS 1600,2
Tashara Leak,3,3,3,"I took this class my first semester of freshman year, and it was very informative! I learned a lot about disease-prevention, healthcare, and other issues important in public health  as well as different aspects of study design. The readings are very important as prelims ask questions about very specific details. Classes were well organized and always interesting!",NS 1600,2
Tashara Leak,5,3,3,"This class was great. The lecture materials were relatively basic, but they provided a great foundation for the field of public health (all the necessary terminology, systems etc). Dr. Leak is fantastic, and all of the assignments were very intentional. There was not much busy work, and there was a semester-long project that focused on designing an intervention to address a public health problem. That was a great application of all that we were learning - but be sure to go to office hours to maximize what you are getting out of the project!",NS 1600,2
Tashara Leak,3,2,3,"This class was okay.. it felt a bit surface-level to me.  Lectures were overall pretty basic. You work on a semester-long group project where you design a study to address a public health issue, which was my favorite part of the course. It felt like we were doing something professional and important.",NS 1600,2
Tashara Leak,5,3,3,I loved this class. It opened my eyes to many public health issues in the US and it taught me how to think think critically about solutions to complex public health problems. I loved Professor Leak  -- she was an amazing lecturer and extremely knowledgable.,NS 1600,2
Jeanne Moseley,3,3,3,This was a good class and it is not hard to get an A. Pop quizzes and assignments were simple if you did the readings and kept up with material. The class was informative and overall enjoyable.,NS 2600,3
Jeanne Moseley,5,1,2,"This course introduced me to the Global Health minor which I ended up pursuing. Learning about HIV/AIDS, Maternal Mortality, and other topics within the realm of global health. Would recommend for everyone who is interested in Global Health!",NS 2600,3

Jeanne Moseley,5,2,2,"Really good class, manageable workload and really cool content",NS 2600,3
John Michael,1,5,3,"Horrible. Strictly graded upon dry memorization of the authors, methods and results of studies you will forget instantly following an exam. this class makes me want to each a cheeseburger everytime i leave. this class had so much potential. if it discussed more relatable work rather than miserable statistics and data and confidence intervals etc etc, it would be enjoyable. but the professor pounds so much data into your head that you will surely lose sight of the big picture. also, the class is sneaky hard (i'm a senior premed). granted, i did nothing for the course and crammed for a few nights in a library before quizzes.",NS 3030,4
Dan Berry,5,3,2,"I took this course hybrid. The content is super engaging and interesting, and I think that the class is well structured to allow people to succeed. The grade for the course was based on two prelims and a short research paper on a topic. Going to the review sessions and really taking the time to think about and form answers to those questions prepares you really well, and following the guidelines for the research paper will have you set to do well.",NS 3150,5
David Levitsky,4,3,2,"Not too bad, similar content to NS 1150 but half of it's new (the part taught by Dan Barry",NS 3150,5
Joanna Fiddler,5,3,3,"This class is super helpful for anyone studying nutrition and digestion or metabolism. The quizzes and exams were fairly difficult (there was a lot of info to memorize), but I was able to learn useful information. Good foundational class for further nutrition classes or research.",NS 3310,6
Marie Caudill,5,4,4,"The professor is super engaging and very sweet! She goes at a great pace and answers questions with lots of clarity. It is a difficult class, but her lectures and quizzes prepare you super well for the prelims, and you learn a lot! The material is also very interesting, highly recommend!",NS 3310,6
Marie Caudill,5,4,4,"An amazing trip through the digestive tract, taking a glimpse at the wonderful variety of nutrients absorbed along the way, growing an understanding of health related to digestion and absorption. Don't underestimate the course, it is a hefty amount of information, but all ties together. Exams make you think, but aren't cruel or tricky. Prepare, ask questions, and you will do well.",NS 3310,6
Kimberly O'Brien,3,4,5,This is definitely a heavy workload and lots of memorization. Lecture is almost every day with frequent quizzes. Professor really tries to interact with students and get them involved. You would get assigned TA who will be a great resource for you. I don't think this class is impossible but you might wanna limit other heavy work classes.,NS 3410,7
Kimberly O'Brien,4,3,4,"This class is required for HBHS students. Anatomy was such a fun class, Professor O'Brien is like the nicest professor I've ever had. While lecture is usually engaging and pretty interesting, it was sooo much work. Lecture is everyday and about 40-50ish slides are covered per class. As long as you keep on top of the material though, the class isn't too hard.",NS 3410,7
Julia Finkelstein,5,4,3,Dr. Finkelstein is a very enthusiastic professor who cares about her students. One of the more difficult Global and Public Health Classes but also one of the more useful.,NS 3600,8

Cliff Kraft,2,3,3,"This class was alright. None of the material was exceptionally challenging, but lectures were boring and people skipped them half the time. As other reviewers have stated, the class was oriented towards the epistemological/philosophical side of sustainability rather than more practical examples. I like some theoretical material, but as an E&amp;S major, I was also hoping to be introduced to more concrete  sustainability topics. Kraft and the TAs are definitely passionate about the material and it shows, but the dull lectures and weekly essays didn't make for the -most- engaging class. Just put a bit of effort into them and show up to section and you'll be alright.",NTRES 1101,10
Cliff Kraft,2,4,4,The weekly essays were annoying. Steer clear of Carl St. John as a TA; he grades so harshly.,NTRES 1101,10
Cliff Kraft,2,2,4,"Not really a fan of the class even though it is my major. the prof was super passionate and it showed, but it was just really boring. There were weekly essays and the TA's graded VERY differently which was very frustrating.",NTRES 1101,10
Cliff Kraft,1,3,2,"Boring class, more like epistemology. Many students falling asleep or skipping lectures. Tests are subjective, you could argue for the different answer choices. Not much sustainability until later in the course. Michael dunaway not a great TA, doesn't really know what he was talking about. Hw assignments every week were annoyingly long/tedious.",NTRES 1101,10
Cliff Kraft,4,2,2,"Good class. The professor is passionate and knowledgable, but the work is much more theoretical than suggested by the course description. Expect to spend a lot of time discussing abstract philosophical concepts that relate to science (truth, rationality, etc.) and not as many concrete discussions of sustainability or environmental issues, at least until the first prelim. The professor and TAs are pretty vague about what you need to study for the exams, so just make sure you can define and provide examples for the key terms brought up in lecture.",NTRES 1101,10

Richard Stedman,5,3,2,"Richard Stedman is honestly the best lecturer i've had so far (in CALS), really prepared for lectures, and makes class interesting. He doesn't have slides so taking notes is a must (or just look at other ppl's quizlets), he usually has a exam review sheet and all possible concepts tested will be on it. Fairly easy but the exams focus alot on details so hard to get high points.",NTRES 2201,12
Richard Stedman,5,3,3,"I really loved this class! You could do the readings if you want/ are interested, but will do well in the class even if you only have time to attend lecture. Stedman is super passionate and a great lecturer. Highly recommend.",NTRES 2201,12
Richard Stedman,5,3,3,"I loved this class! Richard Stedman is a great professor and genuinely enjoys the curriculum he teaches. Prelims are pretty easy and you can probably do well if you just take good lecture notes, but the readings really help to enrich your learning experience, and are good practice if you're not used to reading a lot for classes, so if you're really interested and have the time, I'd recommend doing them.",NTRES 2201,12

Peter Frazier,5,3,3,"I took this class with Madeleine Udell and Frans Schalekamp in Spring 20, and I loved it! Many useful and practical tools were taught in class, including SQL for database, Tableau for visualizations, and Python for prediction. Udell was organized in lecture and recitation materials. She is also passionate about real-life data problems, for example, a couple of lectures were dedicated to introduce COVID-related data analysis projects. Final project in data visualizations and analysis was comprehensive. I appreciate the course experience overall.",ORIE 3120,18
Peter Frazier,3,3,3,The class is not organized and homework was way easier than the actual prelim. The recitation is just busy work which was not very helpful relating to the actual content that we learned in class.

Peter Frazier,1,2,2,"Took with franz and udell in SP20.  Very easy class for CS majors. The first part of the course you learn SQL. The second you learn inventory management calculations. The third you learn data visualization (Tableau) and how to use ML packages in Python. There were weekly psets and recitations. We had in person prelims before the pandemic moved us online. I would say its useful if you're trying to get a shallow understanding in a few different tools to put on your resume. The weirdest part was the inventory management, which I felt was useful to very few and is a left over appendage from old ORIE classes.",ORIE 3120,18

John Richard Callister,1,2,4,"Callister's humor is actually bearable if you get used to it. The real unbearable thing is Callister's attitude towards students asking questions on Piazza - it's almost to a point where you can feel genuine hostility. I think he's an a**hole like this just for this course, since I don't feel any of that in ORIE4600 (this one's also taught by him). The content of the course itself is pretty easy and very some information which is very slightly related to finance is interesting and useful. But overall just a lot of memorization and meaningless, unproductive laws set by accountants. Problem sets are a f**king pain, get ready to have your had ragged since you'll be writing and using a calculator for hours for just one p-set.

Please look into this option as I didn't and now I regret the way I spent a good portion of this semester. Second: if you have to take this course, it'll suck. You'll have to wade through HOURS of busy work and GARBAGE jokes and condescension like you wouldn't believe, but if you memorize all the stupid methods Callister has to solving specific problems, the exams will not be too difficult and you should be easily able to get an A+.",ORIE 3150,19

For people who are not good test-takers (like me), or who make small arithmetic or other errors, this course seems to be designed to make you fail. There were 4 quizzes (each worth 15%) and a final worth 25%, with the remaining divided between the weekly homework assignments. There was no partial credit for both the homework and exams, and the class is not ""curved"" to a median. This class is very easy to pass but incredibly hard to get an A in.

David Goldberg,2,3,3,"Took this class with Prof. Goldberg. While the material from the class was not incredibly challenging, the course structure is by far the worst I have seen so far. For people who are not good test-takers (like me), or who make small arithmetic or other errors, this course seems to be designed to make you fail. There were 4 quizzes (each worth 15%) and a final worth 25%, with the remaining divided between the weekly homework assignments. There was no partial credit for both the homework and exams, and the class is not ""curved"" to a median. This class is very easy to pass but incredibly hard to get an A in.  The best way to prepare for this class is to make it your prime focus for the semester and be very very familiar with ENGRD 2700 (or equivalent), as the material follows from there. ",ORIE 5500,31
Jim Dai,2,4,3,Had Professor Samorodnitsky. The prelim is harder than expected and the lectures are dry. The first half of the class's material is similar to engrd 2700. Homework and recitation are challenging which is not something that's taught in class.,ORIE 5500,31

Jim Dai,2,4,3,"Professor: David Goldberg. This class relies mostly on the quizzes and the final for grade. It seems very easy to score an A because the range is lower than usual, but there are not partial credits on any exams. He only looks at your final answer, if you get it wrong, it's wrong and no formula sheets are given. HWs are long, the first two hws are fair, but the last hw is very difficult.",ORIE 5500,31
Jim Dai,2,4,3,"Professor: David Goldberg. The pace of the class is quite slow, but he dives deep into each topic and instead of having prelims he has 3 quizzes.

Thomas Evans,4,2,2,"This is a pretty easy class. I took it a while ago, but I don't think I learned anything new? Like it was a lot of material I had learned in AP Micro.

The lectures were ok enough. This is a really solid class overall.",PAM 2000,35

Sharon Sassler,2,4,4,Wouldn't recommend this class unless it is a requirement. The grading of the essays is extremely subjective and varies immensely by the TA you get. Is definitely a class where office hours are almost a prerequisite if you are aiming to get around a A-/A. First prelim tested on trivial facts barely mentioned in class/textbook.,PAM 2030,36

There are a lot of readings, but they are generally pretty interesting. Professor Weeden has informative slides with plenty of qualitative and quantitative information, whether or not she goes over the readings varies from lecture to lecture. I suggest summarizing each reading as well as taking note of important data so you can refer back to them easily for the prelims and memos.

The sections are mandatory, but very engaging and have good group discussions. The content itself is great and covers important social topics, some things can be surprising to know too! There are a lot of readings, but I just skim through them. We have to write a reflection paper at the end of the unit and have a weekly quiz.

Brooke Hollis,-,1,-,"The class is more for Brookdale to advertise their branding. The course does not delve into industry challenges, performance.

Nicholas Sanders,5,2,2,"It was fairly easy, really interesting and exciting, and also taught really relevant and applicable skills.

I especially enjoyed the TA (Kendall McAdams) and his humorous but informative demonstrations.

Perks include a gym pass and an optional fitbit for the semester. There is limited written work (setting goals) and assessments (beginning and end of semester to track personal growth). Classes can feel boring/simple but feel short and are a great way to set aside time to use the treadmill or do strength exercises for an hour in the middle of the day. ",PE 1265,73

The hard part isn't hitting, it's the running! Towards the end of the semester, you finally can refine your skills enough to have decent rallies and the games become more fun. The only downside of this class can be the instructor. He can sometimes be funny, but he can be one real nut job. He is not shy in expressing his views about COVID-19 and about the mask mandate.

This is a really fun class and is a great way to get outdoors and get some exercise. Definitely don't overlook this one. You even have an opportunity to overnight sleep in some trees",PE 1657,110
Rob Cook,5,2,1,TAKE THIS PE!!!! This is the best most fulfilling PE you can take.  I went into the class as only a casual biker and left knowing not only technique but also trails at the local Shindagin Hollow State Forest,PE 1664,111
Rob Cook,5,2,1,"Took this class Fall 2019. It's been two years since then but I still think about it regularly. Small class sizes, a few bike rides around the area to get used to riding, and an overnight trip (ours was to Taughannock). Very fulfilling and a great place to meet new people!",PE 1666,112
Mark Holton,5,1,1,Absolutely an amazing class! Please take this! As someone who has NEVER kayaked before I was perfectly fine. We had a couple of meetings before a big camping trip in which we just went to the Adirondacks! Imagine kayaking to a private island with a mini beach and camping there for the weekend. A complete blast!,PE 1674,113

Iago Gocheleishvili,5,3,2,Great class. love the teacher. favorite class so far at cornell!,PERSN 1320,116
Iago Gocheleishvili,5,3,3,"Amazing class! You first learn basic and useful sayings, such as how to say your name and what you work. These phrases become a grammatical foundation. Halfway through the course, I can already write a short essay about myself and my family in the crazy and beautiful Persian alphabet..... and it's written backwards! This is my favorite class, it's a fun and relaxing attitude where it's ok to not know the answer.",PERSN 1320,116
Nathaniel Bulthuis,2,3,2,I had Shaun Nichols who was new to Cornell the semester that I took it.  (This website has not been updated to give him as an option of professor for this class) His lectures are not very engaging and hard to pay attention to.  He does not give you any grades until two weeks past the drop deadline so you have no idea how you are doing until over two months in.  He does not give very much but when he does it is a lot and you have to go over his 200 slide powerpoints to understand how to do it.  If you miss lecture his slides are not very helpful.  Bright side is that his final is not cumulative.,PHIL 1100,117
Nathaniel Bulthuis,-,1,-,"Lectures were meh but the material was super cool. Great overview of Philosophy and really straight to the point. Assignments were useful and not busywork, and the prelim and final were very straightforward.",PHIL 1100,117
Theodore Korzukhin,2,3,3,"This class could have been a lot better than it was when I took it. I think the content was pretty interesting; if you're looking for a very general introduction to a broad variety of topics in philosophy, this class is for you. Unfortunately, Professor Korzukhin's lecture were quiet and hard to follow. The lecture slides were also not shared in order to encourage students to show up to class, but not having them as a resource when studying for exams definitely made the class a lot harder. The readings were not bad in difficulty so if you're looking for an introduction to philosophy, just reading about philosophy in your spare time might be a better option.",PHIL 1100,117
Nathaniel Bulthuis,1,3,3,"This class was overall a disaster. The professor's (Shaun Nichols) lecture slides are hard to follow when you're reviewing on your own, the professor also uploaded amendments to the slides for the final exam a DAY BEFORE the final exam- never in my career at Cornell have I seen such flippancy from a professor. The student doesn't get to know their grade until after the drop deadline which is also extremely considerate, and the student has to chase down TAs to get grades back (which the student receives about a month later). TA's quality is extremely variable so it depends on your luck there. The professor doesn't recognize that most of the students in this class are juniors and seniors taking this class for a distribution requirement- they picked this class because they thought it'd be interesting! Sadly, I'm turned off from philosophy",PHIL 1100,117
Nathaniel Bulthuis,2,3,4,"FA19- I had Shaun Nichols- Unfortunately, this course was not what I had expected. The professor gives no indication of your academic standing until way after the drop deadline, and the midterm was unreasonably hard for an intro class. Slides on topics are 200+ slides and the content sometimes isn't explained very clearly. Quality of TA's is highly variable- I wouldn't recommend this class/",PHIL 1100,117
Karen Bennett,5,1,2,"I thought Bennett was a good lecturer and presented the content in an engaging way. The workload was pretty light, just a few essays, and the content was super interesting.",PHIL 1100,117
Nathaniel Bulthuis,-,3,-,"There were three essay assignments, each counting for 20% of your grade. There were often multiple essay prompts to choose from, but be sure to spend time outlining your argument and going to a TA's or professor's office hours. The length requirement isn't long but the essays are graded rigorously. Take notes on both lectures and readings so that you are prepared to study for finals. Discussion sections were quite helpful. Marta was a great lecturer!",PHIL 1100,117
Marta Heckel,-,1,-,Professor Heckel was pretty great and very understanding of students. Although the lectures were kind of dry and repetitive - discussion makes up for that simply because the concepts are so easy to grasp. Definitely recommend this to any pre-law students.,PHIL 1100,117
Karen Bennett,-,2,-,"I loved Bennett. Great lecturer and the material taught is really interesting. Definitely one of my favorite classes this semester, and it's fairly easy to get an A if you go to your discussions.",PHIL 1100,117

Alex Esposito,5,3,3,"Took w/ Alex Esposito, Applied Ethics. This class hard carried my semester. It was exciting to come to class every week ready to discuss a new philosophical topic, &amp; have debates with the rest of the class. I have no background in Philosophy (STEM major), and thoroughly enjoyed this class, but do know that the essays (there are only really like 2? 3?) are based on philosophical readings that you need to understand. However, Alex goes through them with the class &amp; kind of drills it into your head until you get it, so you don't need to know about Philosophy going in. Grading was extremely light &amp; everyone got As for doing the work. One of the best classes I've ever taken &amp; Alex himself is a deeply entertaining guy -- and a great lecturer. (Also rocks at both basketball &amp; chess.)",PHIL 1110,118
Daniel Manne,5,3,3,"Daniel was a super chill professor who was fine with the occasional lateness. There were required meetings outside of class, but it was really informal and actually helpful to the class and me personally. The only work was five themed essays and biweekly readings (which were hard to skip, but I usually just read them on my way to class / while waiting for people). He was cool with laptops, which was a lot more lax than in my other FWS.",PHIL 1110,118
Alicia Patterson,5,3,4,"I had Bianka Takaoka for Ethics of Friendship, and I will say the readings in this course were rather long even compared to other philosophy classes. Some of the texts we read were classics such as Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, but we also covered some more modern texts like Shafer-Landau. Bianka is very compassionate with grading and general extremely understanding. The papers are quite open and give a ton of flexibility for you to write something you care about.",PHIL 1110,118

Lyu Zhou,2,2,3,"Class is not as interesting as I had hoped. Essays are fairly easy and straightforward though so I don't regret it. Also a short discussion question due at the beginning of each class, but not too hard at all. Information can be redundant but not a hard class to get through with a good grade.",PHIL 1111,119
Yuna Won,3,3,3,Class was ok. Prof was accommodating to extensions but reading assignments were pretty long. You need to put in a reasonable amount of work into the essays especially on the last two. If you put in effort you can get an A. Only recommend if you actually have interest in philosophy ,PHIL 1112,120
Nathaniel Bulthuis,4,4,4,Good class just significantly more work than other FWS.,PHIL 1112,120
August Faller,5,2,3,I took Philosophy of Social Media with August Faller. The topics are very interesting and in-class discussions are also engaging. There are reading assignments before each class. They can be relevant articles (which are kind of long) or a chapter from writing workbooks (very helpful). There are also mini assignments but they are not hard at all. All work is graded on completion.,PHIL 1112,120
August Faller,4,4,4,"I had Ben Sales and it was a very engaging class. The prof loved to bring up interesting counterexamples and hinted at possible objections to arguments while letting students fill in the gaps through discussion. The readings are a bit long, but it's ok to not read it super in-depth but just to get a gist as the expectation is to discuss the material in class. Ben is an average grader, not too hard nor easy. I came out of the class with a deeper interest and understanding of self, identity, and free will.",PHIL 1112,120
August Faller,5,4,4,"This class was the first philosophy class I've taken. Overall, the readings were a bit challenging, but the content was interesting and relevant.",PHIL 1112,120
Nathaniel Bulthuis,-,2,-,"Honestly a great class. I took a class from Freya Moebus, and she is an absolutely nice teacher. (I had to choose a professor so I chose random -- this is wrong. My teacher was F. Moebus)",PHIL 1112,120
William Starr,5,1,1,"This is only offered in the spring and I highly recommend it! It was a lot more interesting than I thought it was going to be and the goal isn't to make you vegan or anything, but more aware of where your food comes from. There is not a lot of work, just reading assignments to do for each class. There are pop quizzes but you will be fine as long as you did the reading. No prelims, 2 papers.",PHIL 1440,121
Anna Haskins,5,2,2,"The course is really interesting and very well structured! Prof. Haskins is one of the best lecturers at Cornell and makes every effort to interact with the class. The sections are mandatory, but very engaging and have good group discussions. The content itself is great and covers important social topics, some things can be surprising to know too! There are a lot of readings, but I just skim through them. We have to write a reflection paper at the end of the unit and have a weekly quiz. No prelims or finals this semester, but we do have to attend two Cornell events (virtual) related to the content and write about them.",PHIL 1950,122
Anna Haskins,4,1,2,It is a really interesting class.,PHIL 1950,122
Anna Haskins,-,3,-,"my favorite class I've taken at Cornell so far!! really interesting content with a professor that is extremely engaging and great with all her students! our only assignments are to do readings (but you can honestly get away with reading the big important ones &amp; just lightly skimming others) &amp; a simply 1 page memo that can be done in 30 minutes, every week. it's not hard to get A's on her exams as long as you review in depth for all materials, but it's easy to do so if you attend lectures &amp; look at her posted slides. sections are really chill too. also a TON of extra credit!",PHIL 1950,122
Anna Haskins,-,2,-,Pretty easy if you go to class and do the readings (they're kind of a lot but really helpful). Section is mandatory but pretty interesting. You have to write a one page (double-spaced) memo each week about the readings and theres 2 in class prelims and one take home final. Professor Haskins is super nice and there are a ton of opportunities for extra credit. It's also a part of the inequality studies minor.,PHIL 1950,122
Anna Haskins,-,3,-,Haskins is wonderful and the class is a great introduction to inequality issues. Everything is straight-forward. Have to do a weekly memo but aside from that there's only the prelims.,PHIL 1950,122
Tad Brennan,4,2,2,There were readings like twice a week. Honestly compared to other 2000 level phil classes seemed less dense (particularly the first half of the semester focusing on plato). Brennan was an engaging lecturer (loved the random eugenics rant) and grading by tas was fair. It is a phil class so you have to write a PHIL paper though. Pretty sure grades per section per essay were under normal distribution.,PHIL 2200,123
Derk Pereboom,3,3,2,"Took this class with Prof. Hubner in SP20. I came in doing the readings and participating in discussions, but eventually got busy enough to not have time to read anymore. The discussion sections are really thought-provoking in this class, and admittedly I didn't enjoy the class as much since I took the class for liberal studies credit (I am not a philosophy major). That being said, the class gave me some new perspectives on life, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic that happened at the time.",PHIL 2220,124
Derk Pereboom,4,2,1,Didn't do the readings ever but discussions were really interesting. We were given a question bank for both the midterm and final and you wrote a free response answer to a couple of the questions so very easy.,PHIL 2220,124
Derk Pereboom,-,3,-,"I am a CS major and I took the class in Spring 2018 with Professor Pereboom. Although he is a very knowledgable and acclaimed professor, his lectures were a bit disorganized. It is not necessary to do all of the reading to do well in the class, there were so many readings that it was hard to keep up. For the exams, he gives a list of 10 questions to prepare the answers to and then asks 2-3 of them during the exam. So with adequate preparation and some understanding of the material you can do well in the class!",PHIL 2220,124
Alexander Kocurek,2,1,2,"Pretty straightforward class for the most part. You learn about puzzles and paradoxes (duh). We learned about 2 paradoxes every week. There were 2 5-min quizzes to take every week (pretty straightforward), 3 papers throughout the semester (which you can honestly do in like 2 days) and 3 exercise sets (like a pset but you get 3 attempts to get around 25 questions correct). Discussions are needed for the participation grade.",PHIL 2300,125
Kate Manne,5,3,3,"Lots of reading, few very dense ones. Very very interesting class with tie-ins to modern issues (covid, policing, female genital mutilation). Highly recommend one to take even if one isnt a philosophy or even humanities major!",PHIL 2410,126
Julia Markovits,5,3,3,"Best class I've taken at Cornell even though I'm a CS major. Really teaches you how to think unlike most other classes here. Just three papers total (1.5k words for first two, 2.5k for final paper) and one final exam that wasn't too bad. The course material is extremely interesting also and really makes you reconsider what you view as moral and immoral.",PHIL 2410,126
Julia Markovits,4,2,2,"Markovits is a great lecturer, to the point where I didn't mind waking up at 9 to go to her lectures, and that's saying something. Lectures &amp; discussion posts based on readings are required for attendance/participation, but discussion posts are easy to BS &amp; lectures are pretty interesting. Final is an easy 100 -- she lets you answer whatever questions you like, and they all count for the same amount. Bulk of the work in this class is the written papers -- I think there were three of them. A clear argument is crucial, but in my experience the prof/TAs are more than willing to completely break it down for you if you put in the effort to meet w them. Overall an interesting, relevant, and not-difficult class.",PHIL 2455,127
Julia Markovits,4,3,3,"Really nice intro phil course on bioethics. There are readings and discussion posts before lec, and attendance is marked for lec and section but all the material is interesting and engaging. They're all very relevant topics and lots of the material had me thinking and asking questions about things I hadn't really thought of before. If you've never written for a phil course writing papers might be a little difficult but if you work with your TA and the prof, they're really helpful. There's one final exam but it's easy, short answer questions. Overall, one of the more impactful liberal arts courses I've taken at cornell.",PHIL 2455,127
Julia Markovits,4,3,3,"The content of the course is super interesting and engaging. Attendance is mandatory for lecture and discussions but, again, the material during lec is really interesting and I honestly enjoyed some of the discussions I've had with classmates during section. If you've never written for a philosophy course, writing papers might be hard but if you work with your TA and prof, you'll be ok. Overall, one of the more impactful liberal arts courses I've taken at Cornell.",PHIL 2455,127
Julia Markovits,4,3,3,"Really good class about bioethics. If you don't really like writing papers and have time thinking about your arguments, it might be tough to write a high quality paper, but overall not too much work aside from reading posts and 3 papers.",PHIL 2455,127
Julia Markovits,5,1,2,This is the best class I've taken at Cornell. The content is so interesting and the workload is really manageable. Prof Markovits is knowledgeable and her lectures are definitely not boring. I highly recommend it to everyone.,PHIL 2455,127
Julia Markovits,5,2,2,"Wonderful course. Enjoyed all of it. Reading for every lecture and discussion posts, but the material is super interesting, and the papers are not graded too harshly. Mini final exam is an easy 100.",PHIL 2455,127
William Starr,-,3,-,"I can't say I really enjoyed this class. Although Professor Starr was really chill, a lot of the class material was quite boring, especially when we discuss the theoretical stuff. I came in with zero knowledge of cognitive science, computer science, or philosophy, and as a result, had quite a difficult time comprehending the material in the readings. At times, for some of the more computer science-y topics, Professor Starr would lecture to us as if we already had some background knowledge in computers, which made it pretty confusing to understand. On top of that, quite a few students would always fall asleep (myself included) b/c it was that boring. To fix that, he implemented Clicker quizzes placed throughout the lecture &amp; they were actually pretty easy quizzes but only if you FULLY did the readings. Really important to fully do the readings!!!",PHIL 2621,128
William Starr,-,3,-,"This is an awesome class. William Starr is a brilliant professor who is super chill and genuinely interested in the material that he is studying. He is young and can relate with the college kiddos. Loved the material, loved the class structure. Take it.",PHIL 2621,128
Robert Lieberman,2,3,3,"Fall 2018 was a flipped classroom style with a reading quiz before every lecture, problem set due every week, and a lab (no postlabs though). The entire lecture is pretty much clicker questions and examples, so if you don't do the reading you won't know what's going on. Jeevak Parpia was not the best lecturer but if you study the textbook material you will do fine.",PHYS 1012,129
Nicholas Taylor,-,4,-,"As an autotutorial class, PHYS 1102 is very challenging and should not be taken unless you have a very good grasp of the subject matter. Even then, the class remained hard to achieve a good grade, just based on not being able to miss very many points at all (you can calculate your grade as you go in the course). Do not take this class alongside other very challenging courses, as it takes a lot of time to complete. In spring 2018, they changed course policies to make it slightly less time-consuming, but learning the material on your own does take awhile. That being said, TA's (both undergraduate and graduate) are very helpful to ensure that you are focusing on what you should for exams and labs. Professor Taylor and Professor Giambatista are very nice and willing to meet with you to help you improve in the course.",PHYS 1102,130
Nicholas Taylor,5,4,5,"Prof Taylor and his teaching team are great and very helpful. I really like auto-tutorial classes, because we get extensive help in the study center. Although the material is challenging, Prof Taylor is very nice and willing to help you learn. But be prepared to do a lot of work, and stay on top of your schedule!",PHYS 1102,130
Philip Krasicky,-,2,-,"Great class. Big time commitment due to mandatory lectures (clickers), discussions, and labs, but this was mostly helpful and we got a lot of practice. Problems were manageable and curve at the end of the class was generous. Fulbright was a good lecturer, Chris Wilson amazing TA.",PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,4,2,3,"This class is a massive time commitment, but if you don't mind the flipped lectures and have some basic physics experience from high school, you should be fine. There are some key concepts that the professor shows in lecture, so it might be worthwhile to pay attention. COOPs are fine, and the virtual labs are really a waste of time. Homework is pretty straightforward. There are a lot of exams, but if you know how to study you'll do fine.",PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,5,2,3,"Professor Krasicky is amazing, his lectures are extremely engaging and I think he explains concepts very well. The class is well organised so it makes sure that you're always on track. The homeworks were mostly only graded for completion and one question for comprehension so it wasn't super stressful. Office hours are incredibly helpful and reviewing the lecture notes and doing the homework are all you need to do to do well on the exams.",PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,4,2,2,Professor Krasicky makes the lecture really fun with cool demos. The content is not hard if you read the textbook. The exam is fair if you are okay with hw and discussion questions.,PHYS 1112,131
Robert Fulbright,5,3,3,"I think this class is a well implemented flipped classroom. Lectures involved solving practice problems and some demos that helped students understand them. Homeworks were sometimes challenging, but helped me teach various physics concepts. Prelims were reasonable, unlike the ones in CHEM 2090.",PHYS 1112,131
Robert Fulbright,-,2,-,"Professor Fulbright was an entertaining lecturer - lots of fun demos that kept me awake and illustrated the concepts.  Literally all the TAs for this class were amazing and super helpful, I would strongly recommend office hours.  If you put in the work to get a good grasp of the weekly homework problems then the prelim and final should be no problem.",PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,4,3,4,"The class was very fun and interesting. The class functions like a flipped classroom which is annoying because you basically teach yourself and have a lot of homework, but the lectures are engaging and clarify any confusion. The demos are very fun too. The prelims are not bad if you understand the material. Very similar to AP Physics C mechanics except more conceptual. ",PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,4,4,5,"There was definitely a lot of work to do and Physics material can be difficult, but the professors give you a lot of resources to do well. Definitely go to study hall office hours to review homework, and use all the practice resources they give you to study for the prelims and final.",PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,4,3,4,Great class!  More work than preferred from reading quizzes but overall great lectures and helpful COOPs and HWs.  Loved the professor and demonstrations- very engaging.,PHYS 1112,131

Robert Fulbright,4,3,3,Loved all of Berts demos every class. Workload is not too bad and prelims are fair.,PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,3,4,5,"Krasicky is a nice professor. His multiple choice questions basically come from the lecture so make sure to take good notes. The class moves really fast and the homework can be challenging.

Robert Fulbright,4,2,4,"Professor is very funny and has great puns. Love the demonstrations despite them being online. However, he still does his best to incorporate feedback to improve quality of education over zoom which is highly admirable. Prelims were also very aligned with what was taught on course. The only bad part of this course is probably the online labs. They're absolutely a pain to go through and I don't find them particularly helpful. I also don't appreciate the amount of quizzes.",PHYS 1112,131
Robert Fulbright,2,4,5,"This class is a huge time commitment due to lectures, labs, and discussions. Reading quizzes that are mandatory before every lecture are graded on correctness and can be time-consuming. You are basically expected to learn everything by yourself through reading the textbook before coming to lecture. Lectures aren't really that helpful but are mandatory due to iClicker questions. Even when the majority of the class gets a question wrong, Fulbright doesn't really explain the concepts well enough or will move on without any explanation. The lab homeworks are on Jupyter notebook which can be a headache and not related at all to lecture material.",PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,3,4,5,"The flipped classroom was difficult for me, because it consisted of a lot of reading before the lecture, and I would be confused. I would have preferred if there were videos to watch instead because I think it would have been more engaging that way. The psets were manageable though tedious because it had so many questions. The exams are very similar to class/home work and coops, so if you study enough and understand the material, it is very possible to get an A.",PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,5,3,3,"Although online, Professor Krasicky made lectures so much more enjoyable and fun! The physics staff is always on top of everything and are always willing to help students in need.  The flipped classroom was somewhat  new to me, so it took me some time to adjust.  I would say reading the textbook always helps,  as well as reading through the lecture notes.",PHYS 1112,131
Philip Krasicky,5,1,4,Professor Krasicky actually made physics fun. My high school physics was horrible because of my teacher. Overall the class was quite easy but I did put a ton of time into it.

Philip Krasicky,-,3,-,"I saw a lot of reviews online saying how bad Parpia was, but I honestly thought he was ok. Lectures were entertaining at times when he did random experiments (like jumping off a ladder), but other than that, I did fall asleep more than once.

The level of difficulty of the homework was so discouraging and made me feel like I wasn't learning anything despite all the effort I was putting in and the heavy workload. The midterm format was two canvas quizzes which basically didn't measure our knowledge whatsoever.

(office hours are held as group study periods with one or two TAs, and are chaotic and stressful in my experience). These problem sets were so crazy hard that even the TAs had no idea how to do them sometimes, and the answer keys they used were often riddled with errors.

Marvin Pritts,5,1,1,"Literally love this class so much. We make floral arrangements and eat bugs but you dont have to and prune trees in Cornell orchard and have so many free plants to take home. Hes so sweet and the class is just really relaxing. It is a long time though, about 4.5 hours but usually you end early",PLHRT 1102,153
Marvin Pritts,5,1,1,Such an enjoyable and low-stress class. We got to plant our own flowers and bring them home :) Every week we had a little quiz and we had a couple reflections scattered throughout the semester. The final project is on a gardening topic of your choice. Definitely recommend! Especially if you need some extra CALS credits.,PLHRT 1102,153

William Miller,4,2,2,"The class itself isn't very hard and the professor explains the concept pretty well. Half of the lectures are guest lectures that were not part of the prelims. There were also no finals when I took the class. There was, however, a large group final project.  The labs were also very easy and the lab blogs could be completed very quickly.",PLSCI 1101,155
William Miller,5,1,2,"I really enjoyed this class and the content! I had Professor Miller and I felt that he was good at going over lecture material and relating it to his personal experiences. This class wasn't very difficult since it's an introductory class and the tests were open note and completed on your own time. There was polling done at the beginning of each class which is a part of your grade, and you also had to write a couple of reflections on the labs you completed, but I felt that everything was graded fairly. The TAs were also fun to listen to and everyone in the plant science community was kind and welcoming.",PLSCI 1101,155
William Miller,5,4,5,Labs are the best part of the class.,PLSCI 1101,155
Frank Rossi,-,3,-,"Class itself isn't that hard (no prelims, only 5 writing assignments throughout the semester plus a final project), but the professor (Frank Rossi) can sometimes be dismissive with questions or clarifying information.

Samuel Blake,5,1,2,"This class was AMAZING!!!! The content was very expansive,  I thought we would just talk about modern drag in the world of RuPaul but we went very far back in history to discuss camp, pivotal moments in the LGBTQ+ movement, and icons in the community! Professor Blake is a dedicated professor who really cares about the work that he does, we had a guest lecturer talk to us about gender and sexuality which goes to show that the content of the class goes beyond the title! Contrary to the name, students never actually perform in drag but we sure do study it. There are weekly readings and a few films in the class but the work definitely wasn't overwhelming. We had a midterm paper that required submitting drafts which definitely kept students in check and then a 6-page final paper which also had a presentation but again, the work was not overwhelming and professor Blake",PMA 1145,162
J Gainor,5,2,3,"Gainor was one of those few teachers that genuinely cared for her students. She was super understanding and provided great writing advice. I love the structure of her class because she allowed for infinite revisions for all the pieces, so your grade is ultimately dependent on how much work you put in. Compared to other FWS classes, I would say this class is on the easier side. There are multiple writing pieces, but each piece allows for creativity, and I found the class as a creative outlet. ",PMA 1161,163
J Gainor,5,2,3,I agree w/ all the other comments on here. J Gainor was the sweetest professor. She helped me through every single essay and graded basically on improvement. It didnt even really feel like an FWS because it was a class I actually enjoyed being in. There were a lot of assignments but she was very nice about giving extensions.,PMA 1161,163
J Gainor,4,2,3,"The professor for this class was super nice and she was very helpful. The workload was slightly overwhelming at times, but I liked how the class was definitely more focused on improvement.",PMA 1161,163
J Gainor,4,2,4,"Gainor was the sweetest professor ever! She was super personable and wanted to help all of her students. She did require a lot of readings for each class but if you didn't complete all of them it wasn't a big deal if you just contribute 1 or 2 things during discussion. She was not that harsh of a grader and allowed for corrections to be done on every essay we handed in. Towards the end of the semester a lot of the assignments began to pile on top of each other so that was overwhelming but if you're good at time management, you'll be fine. Overall loved the class and it's definitely one of the best FWS you can take as a freshman, just be aware the workload can get a bit heavy at times.",PMA 1161,163
J Gainor,5,3,3,"I loved this class! Super interesting and engaging. While the workload could be overwhelming at times, Prof. Gainor was super understanding and helpful. This class definitely didn't seem as heavy as some other FWSes. A lot of short (500-750 word) assignments instead of few long assignments.",PMA 1161,163
J Gainor,3,2,4,"Gainor is such a sweet and understanding professor! But just a heads up, she's kinda tough on grading and has a lot of assignments. She threw 5 assignments at us and it was really overwhelming. But we asked her if she can remove an assignment and she did! In this class we write essays, make podcasts, research grocery stores, and make reality TV show pitches. Overall really interesting class, but definitely a fair amount of work.",PMA 1161,163
Andrew Campana,5,2,3,This is one of my favorite classes at Cornell! Campana is very passionate about teaching and japanese film. You watch 1 film/week and I really enjoyed all of them.,PMA 2452,164
Andrew Campana,5,2,3,"I really enjoyed this class with Prof. Campana! He is a very sweet professor. While I initially expected us to watch more animated film, we analyzed more films that were not. To my surprise, I really enjoyed most/all of the films that we watched and discussed in class even though I dont typically gravitate towards those types of films. The class isn't a ton of work, and I loved watching a new film every week. Would recommend!",PMA 2452,164
Samantha Sheppard,-,2,-,"Professor Sheppard is a great teacher, and the topic was really interesting! HW was a lot of reading, but most texts were interesting anyway. This class is a lot of class discussion, so you can't really squeak by without doing the reading. She said this won't be taught again for a few years, but I recommend it when it comes back!",PMA 2501,165
Philip Lorenz,4,2,3,"Small class size with very energetic and approachable professor. Work mostly consists of reading the plays assigned. There are also a couple papers that you have to write, but they are pretty open-ended and interesting to write.",PMA 2670,166
Roger Gilbert,4,3,3,Overall a really interesting class about Shakespeare! I took this for the pre-1800 req. Learned a lot about both Shakespeare theatre/cinema + the text itself.,PMA 2681,167
Roger Gilbert,4,2,2,I really like how this class was a mix of cinema + text. Prof Gilbert has a lot of interesting things to say and I feel that the class discussions/lectures were very fruitful. I took this for the pre-1800 req.,PMA 2681,167
Carolyn Goelzer,4,2,2,"Excellent course! Carolyn is the best and cares so much for her students. She has lots of fun exercises for us that help us bond closer together, so that when we do somewhat awkward stuff in acting or stand up in front of the class to perform a scene, it feels a lot easier. Almost no work outside of class (kinda wish there was more as I felt we could've learned more) but it was a chill time.",PMA 2800,168

J. Ellen Gainor,-,2,-,"Do not take with Gainor!!!!!!! Intro to Acting is the one course I took that everyone seems to love, but it is so dependent on the professor. My professor, unlike some others, took the assignments (readings/papers) too seriously. I actually put effort into this course, read everything, completed everything, and actually tried acting and took every note she gave me, but still ended with a B or B+ I can't remember, but still #salty about it.",PMA 2800,168
Timothy Murray,5,3,3,"Even though it was 3 hours long, I really liked this course! The lectures were very engaging (Murray picks a diverse, interesting array of videos to show during lecture). I learned so much + I recommend for those who are interested in learning more about video art and media.",PMA 3515,169
Amy Villarejo,-,3,-,"Professor Villarejo is amazing! I took this class Spring '17 and really loved it. This class challenged me to watch films from different genres, countries, and time periods that I normally would not have otherwise seen. There are a lot of readings assigned, but to be honest you don't have to read them all in depth to contribute fairly to discussions. The essays assigned as the take home final exam were very easy to work with since they were mostly based off class discussions.",PMA 3551,170
Warren Cross,4,1,2,Definitely a bit boring at times if you already have experience with sound design and production. Professor Cross is really knowledgable and super cute and caring. The class is what you make of it,PMA 3680,171
Warren Cross,4,2,2,Warren Cross is extremely knowledgable in the field and extremely accomodating during COVID really enjoyed the lectures and the projects were straightforward and not very time consuming,PMA 3680,171

Aoise Stratford,5,2,3,"I took this class as a non-PMA major and loved it! It was fun to read plays, collaborate and workshop with other students, and in general just tap in to my creativity.  Prof. Stratford is a wonderful and kind professor who is super knowledgable and involved in the local theater scene.",PMA 3805,173
Austin Bunn,-,2,-,"I loved this class! Prof Stratford is great and leads super helpful discussions. In this class you'll learn how to write 10-minute plays (you'll write two plays) and read lots of examples for inspiration.  It's not technically part of the Creative Writing track (I think it's mostly PMA students who take it), but it's a great elective to take if you're a CW student anyway!",PMA 3805,173

The quizzes were based off of the lectures and the textbook readings so as long as you took good notes, the quizzes were pretty easy. We also had to make 3 quality annotations in the textbook per week (really easy to do). There were also extra credit opportunities that added 5% to the final grade. Super easy and chill class!",PSYCH 1101,176
David Pizarro,5,1,3,"This is a very informative and fairly easy class! Professor Pizarro makes each lecture interesting.

Also, you have the opportunity for extra credit opportunities through participation in SONA studies.",PSYCH 1101,176
David Pizarro,4,3,2,"Professor Pizzaro changed the course to fit for Covid-19 with some benefits and drawbacks. One of the benefits was decreased workload. 5% of the grade was made up of annotations on the textbook, which were open-ended and graded fairly. You only had to make three annotations per week. 95% of the grade was based on 8-10 question quizzes rather than the usual midterm and final of previous years. The benefit of the quizzes were that you only had to study for one chapter each time, but there was a lot of information to memorize for such a small quiz.  There was luckily an opportunity for extra credit that many of the students took advantage of, which was completing 5 SONA psych participation credits for an additional 5% added to the final grade.",PSYCH 1101,176

David Pizarro,4,2,2,"I probably had an easier time in this class just because I took it during COVID-19 times (the professor dropped prelims and replaced them with weekly 6-8 question quizzes). There was no final or midterm either.

Its very important to go to the office hours before the prelim: he answers some of the questions for you and you can check your answers with him.

Cheat sheets were allowed for the exams. You can take this as a 3 or a 4 credit class. The additional credit taught us SPSS statistics and was worth it.

Then again, I came from a high school with a course with extensive writing practice, and there were periodic lectures devoted to improving writing that mirrored the strategies I previously learned, so you are",ROMS 1113,208
Itziar Rodriguez de Rivera,-,2,-,"Thinking and Thought: On Love has been one of my favorite classes this semester. If you take it with Professor Rodriguez, you will have such an enjoyable time because she is so nice and chill. Most of class time is spent discussing any articles, reading selections, or movies, which are not a lot of reading/watching and are actually quite enjoyable. Other times we just have peer review workshops or just practice with writing exercises. These are usually assigned between essays, and out of 5 essays, we have 3 that are drafts. Overall, great class, and you will definitely enjoy this class if you are interested in learning more about the different aspects of love.",ROMS 1113,208
Ti Alkire,5,2,2,"Best FWS! Ti is super sweet and understanding (will give extensions), and the material is genuinely interesting. It was lecture-heavy at first, but learning about film/food/movies is super interesting",ROMS 1114,209
Ti Alkire,5,1,2,The class material is really interesting and the class itself is pretty chill. It is mostly discussion in breakout rooms about the reading. The essays are pretty chill and the professor give you a lot of good feedback. He also lets us choose what kind of topics we are interested in.,ROMS 1114,209
Timothy Murray,5,3,3,"Even though it was 3 hours long, I really liked this course! The lectures were very engaging (Murray picks a diverse, interesting array of videos to show during lecture).

Ti Alkire,-,3,-,"This is by far one of the coolest linguistics classes I've taken. Although it did require a lot of memorization of sound changes, the lectures followed the textbook very closely so studying wasn't too difficult. Professor Alkire is so nice and extremely knowledgeable about the subject - he had an answer to pretty much every random question brought up in class, and if he didn't, he went to the library for the answer and told us during the next class. Workload is pretty light but there is some rather dense reading. He said at the beginning that ""As long as you show up to lecture and try your best you'll get a good grade."" Material is super interesting if you like romance languages. I've never really been a phonetics/phonology person but this class may have changed that - our relative chronology problems are actually pretty fun. The final is a take-home exam and there's a couple of quizzes,",ROMS 3210,211
Ti Alkire,4,2,3,"He only offers this course if there's enough interest from 3321. Good continuation of the first course, but structured differently. You go into a lot more detail about more obscure topics, like Romanian, verb paradigms, and medieval texts -- which was pretty cool but difficult to read. Personally I wouldn't have been disappointed if it wasn't offered, but I also don't regret taking it.",ROMS 3220,212
Kendra Bischoff,3,2,1,"Course contents are slightly basic -- it's an intro class. Readings are not difficult, but there are many of them.

Landon Schnabel,4,2,3,The class is pretty interesting but there are two quizzes every week. The reading quizzes will require you to go through the readings even though there are usually many. The weekly quizzes have questions based on the reading and lecture so you have to pay special attention to the lectures.,SOC 1101,213
Kendra Bischoff,4,2,3,Prof Bischoff is SO NICE and super interesting. The readings can be a little long but are discussed thoroughly in class and section. The content is very interesting and this class made me want to take more sociology just to have prof Bischoff again. Assignments aren't bad either.,SOC 1101,213
Anna Haskins,3,1,3,"This was a good introductory class! If you do the readings and pay attention in class, then you can actually learn a lot of information applicable to life. I took half the class normally and the other half online due to COVID, but both ways, it was easy to get an A+ (especially with extra credit). Prelims before COVID were short-answer but not difficult if you generally understand the material and kept up with readings. Weekly quizzes during COVID asked more specific questions about readings, making the class slightly harder, but everything was open-note. Discussion sections were not at all helpful, but if you participate, you get full credit. Assignments are not harshly graded.",SOC 1101,213

Filiz Garip,4,2,2,This course is a fun introduction to sociology and the professor provides movitation and a summary of a wide breadth of different areas in sociology. The class is well taught and makes use of small group activities and discussions during lectures and discussion sections to provide engagement. This class has a very low workload and is mostly exams based. I did not like the exams because they involve memorizing keywords from the slides and regurgitating them onto the exam which does not really promote understanding and just forces you to spend a lot of time looking at the slides. I believe you also had to write a reflection of the previous week's materials every week and that accounted for part of the grade.,SOC 1101,213
Kendra Bischoff,5,2,1,Professor Bischoff is nice and really tries to get to know her students. Content is very straight forward and prelims weren't very difficult.There's a weekly 1 page discussion response that doesn't take very long is majority of the workload for this class. Would recommend if you are interested in the topic at all.,SOC 1101,213
Filiz Garip,3,2,1,"Since it is an intro course, the content is straightforward and mostly common-knowledge. It is easy to get an A in this course, so a good GPA booster and it counts for liberal studies for COE! You do have to write a one-page summary each week based on the readings, but you can skim through them. The prelims and finals are all based on the lecture slides. The sections are simple too, just discussing situations in a group. Professor Garip is a really nice lecturer and interacts during the lecture, so it's pretty lively. Overall, this course is not time-consuming.",SOC 1101,213
Kendra Bischoff,3,2,3,There is no prelims and you just take weekly classes which is a new and more beneficial class structure.

I definitely think Professor Alvarado could have tried to go a bit deeper into certain topics, but I still learned a lot about America's history of racism through the assigned readings and textbook. The reading reflections were tedious but not unreasonable, and the open-book exams were not difficult if you attended lectures. There were also a lot of guest speakers which was a nice element of the class, though some were more engaging than others.

David Easley,3,3,3,"I found the material very interesting. We had problem sets almost every week, in total 9 problem sets, with the worst one dropped. The grading is pain in the ass though, because they grade it unnecessarily harsh as if they are trying to make the course seem artificially more difficult. I wouldn't say that the material is difficult, the graders are just bad. They would acknowledge that your answer is correct but not give you the full credit because apparently it's not in the form that they wanted you to answer it. And as if that wasn't bad enough by itself they also make you type the answers because they can't be bothered reading the handwritten answers. Overall it is an interesting course if you take it for S/U and not worry about the ass graders.",SOC 2090,217

They barely taught grammar; you teach it to yourself for homework and then go over it for 5 minutes in class and spend the rest of the time discussing readings and movies. There was a lot of homework every day, which was just tedious. Exams were fully based on grammar, so if you're comfortable with grammar you'll do really well even if class time is uncomfortable. If you don't know your grammar but can speak, you'll have an easy time in class but struggle on the exams where it counts.",SPAN 2090,237

This class was fantastic and made me want to pursue the spanish major, largely based off of my experience with Tomas. He was an extremely engaging professor who showed his love for the course material by leading very insightful discussions, and there was always a wide variety of ways in which material was taught and in which we were assessed (quizzes, presentations, skits, etc). Overall great class and I highly recommend it!",SPAN 2095,238
Tomas Bevia,4,3,3,"The solid class that will help you improve your Spanish. However, it is relatively similar to other Spanish classes offered in Cornell and you will not be required to talk much more than you would in other small, discussion-based seminars. The professor is really fun but can also be strict at times. You read/watch a variety of interesting works and there is a slight focus on scriptwriting. Would recommend if you are interested in Spanish, yet do not take it because you think this will help your speaking enormously more than other classes.",SPAN 2130,239
Alvaro Garrote Pascual,2,4,3,"The professor was great but as someone who is not a native speaker of Spanish, I found this class to be very challenging. I took this class after completing SPAN 2095 and I would recommend taking other higher-level classes before taking this one. Since the readings are from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the old Spanish used is different from modern-day Spanish and is much more difficult to understand. The class also included a lot of class discussions which was difficult for me since many of the other students were native speakers.",SPAN 2170,240

It actually felt like more speaking, and moderately formal speaking, was required in this class than the advanced speaking class. However, this will certainly help you improve. Small class sizes mean a chance to get to know the professor and classmates well enough that you will become very comfortable with them. Finally, the class really did its job and improved my writing in Spanish.",SPAN 2180,241
Cecelia Lawless,4,3,2,"Really enjoyable Spanish class that touches on several different topics. Definitely less work and less stressful than the advanced writing or advanced speaking classes. However, by this point, people taking the class should be interested in Latin America and its writing/art. Professor expects effort but if that is there, you will be fine. If you qualify for the class by official Cornell standards/past classes, your Spanish level should be fine. Definitely worth checking out!",SPAN 2205,242
Simone Pinet,-,4,-,I really do not recommend taking this class unless it is required. The material is extremely dry and the professor didn't really add to the class. Assignment expectations were vague and it made it really hard to succeed in this class. (Taken with professor Pinet),SPAN 2235,243

If you don't plan on doing anything stats related with your major and just need to get an intro class out of the way for credit, this class is for you. The professor was very accommodating, but rather passive aggressive at times. The final project was a 1500 word essay and study design on how cheating in classes hurts people.",STSCI 2100,264
M. Karns,4,3,3,"I took this course with Professor Karns in Spring 2020.  I liked her and thought she was very methodical, but some consider her old-school and not in a good way.  Pre-covid she emphasized keeping up with the work through in-class clicker participation.  Exams were reasonable and you got to use a cheat sheet.  Post-covid she made the classes very flexible where most people could get an A.",STSCI 2100,264
M. Karns,4,1,2,This class was alright. Karns is a good professor and obviously cares about her students. The content is also not difficult and the tests are totally manageable. I never read the textbook and was fine,STSCI 2100,264
Kevin Packard,4,2,3,"Professor Packard is super nice and easygoing, I had him in Fall 2020 (virtual). Math is not my strong point but he made his lectures easy to follow along (his notes are super detailed), and the workload he assigns is do-able. As long as you keep up with his quizzes and homework, you're pretty much set for the prelims. I would also recommend going to your TA's office hours and discussions because they go over material from lecture more in-depth.",STSCI 2100,264
M. Karns,1,3,4,"Karns is a rude professor, not accommodating at all. Passive aggressive. Not technologically savvy.  I am very disappointed to have her as my professor and I think that she is a poor reflection of what Cornell professors should be like.",STSCI 2100,264
M. Karns,3,2,3,"I took this class in Spring 2019. There were clicker questions that counted for both accuracy and participation. There were 3 prelims and 1 final, and the 3rd prelim was optional. The prelims were pretty easy if you studied, and we always got to use a cheat sheet, which was really nice. The lectures were often unclear and had mistakes in them, which was a bit frustrating. There were a few projects/homework assignments that were pretty time consuming. Overall, not that hard of a class if you put the effort in. Also, make sure to always go to discussion because the TAs were super helpful with reviewing concepts and helping with projects.",STSCI 2100,264

Melissa Smith,5,3,3,I love professor Smith so much. She knows many students names even in a huge lecture class and always stays longer in her office hours to help. The class is okay if you put in the work. Attending lab section really helps with the homework sets!,STSCI 2150,265
Melissa Smith,5,2,3,This class is definitely my favorite at Cornell so far. I took it in the fall and loved how Prof. Smith included relevant and current examples. The lab homeworks were useful but somewhat time consuming. Prelims were fair and one practice prelim was provided to study from for each prelim. She also took the time to learn students' names before lecture started - her passion for stats and teaching sets high standards for all my future courses; couldn't have asked for a better intro stats course!,STSCI 2150,265

Weekly ""quizzes"" can be taken as many times as you want which is cool.",STSCI 2200,266
Cecilia Earls,3,2,1,Took the class with Professor Entner. Overall the class was a pretty easy  intro stats class. Entner was an enthusiastic lecturer but didn't necessarily explain the concepts that well. He made attendance mandatory for the lectures which was annoying for an 8:40 class.

Assignments were once-weekly quizzes which involved searching through the textbook for the right formula and then plugging in the given numbers. Professor Wells, while a very nice and helpful teacher, constructed lectures that were purely walls of equations that made no sense to me or anyone I knew in the class. I expected to bomb the class but it turned out that understanding the lectures was not at all necessary to do well on the final (cheat sheet with equations allowed).

Amy Villarejo,-,3,-,"Professor Villarejo is amazing! I took this class Spring '17 and really loved it. This class challenged me to watch films from different genres, countries, and time periods that I normally would not have otherwise seen. There are a lot of readings assigned, but to be honest you don't have to read them all in depth to contribute fairly to discussions. The essays assigned as the take home final exam were very easy to work with since they were mostly based off class discussions.",VISST 3176,285

RECOMMEND!!!,WRIT 1380,288
Athena Kirk,2,4,4,"Professor Kirk was a kind and enthusiastic professor and really cared about what students had to say in class. However, I would advise only to take this class if you have a strong interest in Greek literature and are able to read a lot before every class and come prepared to discuss. I personally struggled to complete the readings before class and the reflection assignments, and it took up a lot of my time. I did like that the class was small and that I got to know my classmates over zoom, unlike my larger lecture classes.",CLASS 2603,289
Todd Clary,4,2,1,"Prof Clary is awesome! Such a sweet guy who really enjoys the content he teaches. I took the class because of my past interest in Percy Jackson, but it definitely was not too similar (either way, still cool content).

Definitely suggest the class for someone looking for interesting content and a chiller class.",CLASS 2604,290
Todd Clary,4,2,1,"professor clary is so knowledgeable and a great lecturer. this class was pretty chill except i found the tests kind of hard (as a freshman, maybe i was just a baby in terms of college work). just pay attention to what he says, take notes, and word vomit it on the tests and you should be fine",CLASS 2604,290

CaitlÃ­n Barrett,-,2,-,Super weird class. Lots of reading. The content of the course was odd and mostly irrelevant. Probably don't take.,CLASS 2646,294
Tad Brennan,4,2,2,There were readings like twice a week. Honestly compared to other 2000 level phil classes seemed less dense (particularly the first half of the semester focusing on plato). Brennan was an engaging lecturer (loved the random eugenics rant) and grading by tas was fair. It is a phil class so you have to write a PHIL paper though. Pretty sure grades per section per essay were under normal distribution.,CLASS 2661,295
Nathan Pilkington,-,3,-,"Interesting lectures that aren't mandatory, and he posts the lecture slides, but if you aren't in class you will miss tons of important information. Good bit of reading for homework but easy enough to skim. Only 2 prelims and 2 essays, no final. If you go to discussion one day a week, you only have to write 1 essay. Interesting class, and Strauss is a decent lecturer.",CLASS 2675,296
Barry Strauss,4,2,2,"This is a pretty interesting class. It is taught chronologically, from the Iliad to Alexander and then from the rise of the roman republic to the fall of the roman empire.

Shaun Nichols,5,2,3,Probably the best and the most interesting course that I have taken at Cornell. Took it with Shaun Nichols spring 2021. The lectures were really helpful and covered everything. The workload was very manageable. Weekly quizzes and discussions definitely help prepare for the prelims and the final. All the exams were open book and the final was non-cumulative. I definitely recommend it! The reason I chose to major in cognitive science!,COGST 1101,302
Stewart McCauley,4,2,2,Took it with Shaun nichols. Interesting material presented in a slightly boring way. The 3 prelims were take home and we only had a small discussion post and quiz every week. Definitely take it if he teaches it again.,COGST 1101,302

Khena Swallow,2,4,3,"I found the content of this class to be interesting but the delivery is somewhat lackluster. Attendance holds weight to your grade since there's clicker questions.

Khena Swallow,-,3,-,"Thought this class would be a lot more interesting than it really was.

Jennifer Schwade,-,3,-,"Memorization, memorization, memorization. Professor Schwade clearly does put in effort, but prelims are all memorized topics from the lecture slides and the textbook (which you can find online).

Cindy Hsin-Liu Kao,5,1,1,"Really chill and interesting class! Workload was really light, just discussion posts for recorded lectures (took F21). The main work consisted of 3 design projects (idea and prototype) and then putting them together into a portfolio at the end, which was really open-ended and not too much work. There was also a final project which was also basically writing out design ideas for different combinations of projects and topics that we saw in class.

Some advice: get a good study group (Evans makes these really easy to set up) and go to his office hours before the prelims/final.

Although Professor Starr was really chill, a lot of the class material was quite boring, especially when we discuss the theoretical stuff. I came in with zero knowledge of cognitive science, computer science, or philosophy, and as a result, had quite a difficult time comprehending the material in the readings. At times, for some of the more computer science-y topics, Professor Starr would lecture to us as if we already had some background knowledge in computers, which made it pretty confusing to understand. On top of that, quite a few students would always fall asleep (myself included) b/c it was that boring. To fix that, he implemented Clicker quizzes placed throughout the lecture &amp; they were actually pretty easy quizzes but only if you FULLY did the readings. Really important to fully do the readings!!!",COGST 2621,307

Shimon Edelman,-,2,-,"This is potentially the weirdest class I've ever taken at Cornell. Professor Edelman wrote the textbook that you have to buy, then quoted himself in the lecture slides that he wrote as if he didn't write the textbook. This entire discipline seemed like something that he made up himself so he could teach a class about it and hear himself talk. Your entire grade in the class is 3 exams that are legit 5 multiple choice questions and 2 short answers. I got a 75 on one of the exams I studied hard for and a 98 on one of the exams where I legitimately made everything up. This class legit could be an easy A or an easy D it's unpredictable. Don't go to lecture because it is painfully boring to sit through and do the readings before the exam and hope for the best. But also just don't take this class.",COGST 3140,308
Shimon Edelman,4,2,1,"Professor Edelman really changed up the structure of the class in response to virtual class and he seems to care about his students. A virtual semester consists of small weekly readings with annotations on Perusall and a weekly micro essay about the topic of the week with a max of 500 words. Topics are really interesting and light work kept me motivated, but I could see how a semester with prelims and finals could make the content seem tedious.",COGST 3140,308
Christiane Linster,4,2,2,"This class is pretty nice because of how relaxed and stress free it is due to how Professor Linster tries to run it. All of the homeworks are graded on completion, and the graded assignments/exams are graded leniently, and you can turn them into the professor beforehand to get it checked over before you turn it in for real. The content is still conceptually difficult, but it's pretty interesting and beginner friendly even if you don't have neuroscience background! If you take the four credit version, you get to directly implement concepts about the brain in class with code. The only complaint I have is that I feel like the content isn't super concrete, and there isn't a lot of practice/real confirmation of what the ""correct"" answers are for the exercises we do.",COGST 3300,309

Mats Rooth,2,3,3,I took this with Mats Rooths during covid. Every lecture it felt like the professor was winging it as he went. He was always late to class (5-10 mins). Homework felt all over the place. Final project was also sort of ambiguous. No exams just projects. Grading was not too bad though. The class is very disorganized. This class is very linguistics focused too and you use software mostly to do linguistics stuff EX: foma. The hard part is coming up with grammar etc...,COGST 4240,313
John Hale,1,4,5,"I took the class with Professor Marten van Schijndel (not the one listed above). More than half the psets (which were actually coding projects except for a few written questions) took more than 20 hours, although the short ones took a range of 1 to 5 hours. There were 7 psets total.  This is a predominantly CS class although it's cross-listed in LING and COGST. The lectures were interesting, but the projects (psets) were extremely frustrating, and the professor and the TA gave out obscure answers when asking for help.  I'm also not sure how much I learned from the projects. I ended up with a good grade, which is based on the projects and some participation, but wouldn't have taken it if I had to choose again.  Definitely know a friend you can discuss with or get to know someone if you take the class.",COGST 4240,313
Claire Cardie,1,4,4,"This class is highly disorganized, and it doesn't seem like the professor has a major hand on the course logistics. The projects are difficult not because of the content but because of the ambiguity in the description and the grading schema.

The grades and projects are never released on time, yet they still expect the students to somehow meet the deadline.",COGST 4740,314
Claire Cardie,2,5,5,"I came into the class with high expectations for NLP but this class really disappointed me by the way it's taught and kind of killed some of my interest of the subject. The lectures didn't prepare me for the projects at all. We went through algorithms in class but nothing about the implementation conventions. If you are not familiar with PyTorch and all those NLP packages, it will be a huge pain to search the documentation and often I didn't even know where to start because no one tells me what to look at. Thus, the projects are super time-consuming. I spent much more time on this class than on 3410 which is known for its heavy workload. Also, idk if it's bc the class is in the morning, the lecture is super dry and dead, the professor and the PhD lecturer really lack some enthusiasm in teaching and thus made the material much less engaging than it should have been.",COGST 4740,314
Claire Cardie,1,5,5,"I hated this class. The lectures are extremely boring and never talk about the actual code. And they expect you to code an entire neural network. My friends and I were lost the entire time, I've never been so confused in a class.",COGST 4740,314
Claire Cardie,1,4,5,"I took this class because I want to learn about NLP, but was thoroughly disappointed on the course structure, or more accurately speaking, the lack of structure. CS 4740 was one of the classes that fit my schedule for Fall 2020 where I took this class online. Lectures were decent, but could be better, there was a technical microphone issue where the professor's audio was practically inaudible and students were not able to hear clearly. Project guidelines were long, open-ended, overly wordy, and required students to write tedious code that were not directly related to class material.",COGST 4740,314
Claire Cardie,-,3,-,"I really regret taking this class over my other options. Prof. Cardie's lectures are almost entirely based on Jurafsky's textbook. The examples and figures in her slides are straight from that textbook, and thus you can skip most of the lectures if you just do the reading. Honestly, I think reading the textbook is the more efficient way to learn the materials since her lectures are poorly organized. She spends a lot of time explaining linguistics concepts but not enough time on math and algorithms. This is very troublesome if you have a big project team (3-4 people), because you will be expected to implement logistic regression, MEMM, etc. She does not teach these algorithms that are necessary to finish your project but happily wastes time talking about IBM Watson, which is just an interesting side thing. In sum, her lectures are not informative; the projects have interesting topics but you have to do a lot of self-studying to do them properly and thus they may end up taking too much time. Deep learning is the future of NLP. You will be better off skipping this class and instead take the free Stanford online course Deep Learning for NLP.",COGST 4740,314
Lillian Lee,2,4,5,"I regret taking this class. Workload insane. Unorganized. As much as I still love both prof Lillian and Marten and the context, this class was a disaster. I put in so much effort and still ended up with my worst grade of the semester.",COGST 4740,314
Lillian Lee,2,4,4,"Took it with Lillian and Marty. Lillian didn't lecture, only Marty did and he wasn't the best. The organization of the course definitely needs improvement. Throughout assignments, the profs would constantly update the requirements and instructions, even just a few days before the due date.",COGST 4740,314
Claire Cardie,1,3,5,"Awful lecture, and heavy project.",COGST 4740,314
Claire Cardie,3,3,3,"Professor Cardie got rid of exams for COVID-19. Overall the class was interesting but very disorganized- the projects are super vague and take up a lot of time just figuring out what to do. TAs had to have emergency office hours at midnight because a ton of students struggled to submit an assignment the night of. Also, the professor had a graduate student lecturing half the time and the quality of those was not as good/hard to follow which was disappointing. The structure of the class didn't make sense as a hybrid (like breakout rooms when half the students are in-person and half online).",COGST 4740,314
Claire Cardie,2,4,4,"The content of the course can be interesting and helpful if you are genuinely interested in NLP. It is a very project-heavy course where we implement the different models learned in lectures, which takes a lot of time. I had three projects with a partner and the last one alone. No finals or prelims this semester. The lectures are very theoretical, so it can take extra work to translate all the information into code. Prof. Cardie did make it a little interactive by using breakout rooms. We had a few quizzes throughout the semester, which were fine if you go through practice questions. Also had to write a one-page critique paper on different research papers, not too hard, but would have liked more feedback/guidance on that.",COGST 4740,314
Jonathan Park,-,4,-,"THE single most disorganized class I have ever taken. I was really excited about the subject material, but this class was very poorly executed. Lectures are okay (kinda boring, but Claire is clearly very knowledgeable and a sweetheart). But the TAs are entirely responsible for the projects and as a result they are far too underspecified (most people don't even know where to start) and only about 1 TA will understand it well enough to help. For one project, the class was so clueless that they had to hold a 3 hour Saturday lecture (**the day before it was due**) just to explain what the project was asking.",COGST 4740,314
Jonathan Park,-,3,-,"Professor Cardie's lectures are extremely dry and boring. The nice part is that she usually brings her dog to do a trick during the beginning of class. The exams are essentially based on memorizing the textbook/class slides.  However, the material itself and projects are interesting. I would still recommend taking the class for the stuff you will learn.",COGST 4740,314

Van Le,4,3,4,"This class provided me with life-long tools to analyze films but would I do it again? I'm not 10% sure. There are some benefits of taking this class over others, which mainly comes from having to watch films over reading books. The thing is, the class can also suck the joy out of watching films because it becomes a chore. There's a required film to watch once a week for roughly 11 weeks, with a 250 word review/response to the movie required once a week. This doesn't seem like much, and I acknowledge that you're probably thinking that I've never experienced a hard course in my life, but it takes a toll after a while. This is on top of the essays that are due every two weeks (total of 5 essays). I was already up to my ears in engineering courses and I had to manage to squeeze in time between writing lengthy lab reports and finishing up problem sets to sit down and analyze a film that was more than likely uninteresting and in a language I didn't speak or understand. No issue with other films in other languages EXCEPT for the fact that you're trying to read the subtitles while analyzing the scenes for things to write about and the two hour film suddenly",COML 1104,315
Van Le,1,4,5,"This class is absolutely one of the worst decisions I have ever made to take.  First of all, they mislead with the course description. Despite going into detail on what the class entails, we were surprised day one when we were told that our first half of the semester would be Chinese Film, and then we would switch to world film. No problem with that, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW THAT. Then they tell us that we will also be switching professors halfway through the course.  Week after week we are given feature length films followed by 250 word comments. The essay prompts are uninspired and lazy. The teachers: Keyun Tian and Junting Huang grade more like a STEM course than anything in COML. Often giving us 5 page essays the same weekend as a film and our weekly post, the teachers seem unconcerned by the workload and when it is assigned. Most notably, nearly all of our assignment are due on weekends. I would not reccomend this class to anyone who doesn't fit all of the following categories: speaks several languages fluently, prefers all of their worked focuses in a very short timespan, and unbearable 75 minute discussions",COML 1104,315
Van Le,5,3,3,"I took the class Fall of 2019. Usually, Reading Films has a special theme Africana, German films etc. My class's theme was Hong Kong, Taiwanese, Chinese Films. My grad student was super knowledgeable and easy to talk to. 5 essays total, a 2-3 hour film every week the grad student is Keyun Tian. I picked Van Le because it won't let me submit without picking a professor. Keyun Tian is not in the database.",COML 1104,315
Marc Kohlbry,4,4,3,"Marc was a decent professor but wasn't the most approachable. It was not an easy class to get an A in. However, my papers got a lot of helpful feedback.

I feel like there was definitely more potential for discussions and topics in this class.",COML 1106,316
Joe Zappa,4,3,3,"Class was definitely not what I expected: it was a philosophy-heavy course where we didn't really talk much about robots. That said, the course was enjoyable, although getting an A on the essays was difficult. The workload was manageable, but is a participation-important class!",COML 1106,316
Oliver Aas,4,3,3,The class was fun overall. You talked about interesting subjects most of the time -- though I would have liked it better if it had tackled problems in more detail. Still a good FWS.,COML 1106,316
Marie Lambert,3,2,3,"This class has super interesting content and  the readings/material are super engaging. I really enjoyed that component. I think it really depends on how the professor formats the class and who is in your section. Since the course is mostly discussion-based, if people aren't willing to talk it gets pretty boring and kind of awkward. I also didn't feel like my writing improved that much in the course, which I had expected. Took the class with Aas, who is really nice, not listed here as an option for professor",COML 1106,316

Raissa Krivitsky,3,3,3,"I had a decent experience in the class. I cannot recommend it enough that you discuss your ideas with the professor BEFORE you write your essay. Many people in the class had to scrap their work because it did not fit with what she was looking for. There are readings for every class (usually around 8-12 pages), and most times you have to write a 1-2 page paper. Definitely, I did more work here than my first FWS, and if you are just looking for an easy A, you should look elsewhere. If you are into Russian literature, you would enjoy this class!",COML 1119,317
Raissa Krivitsky,3,3,3,"An FWS that usually assigns a lot of lengthy readings that seem to always revolve around food. The professor expects a lot of participation during class, so you always need to be on top of the readings. If you're interested in Russian culture, I would recommend it, but if you're expecting a light or medium load, look for a science-related FWS.",COML 1119,317
Andrew Moisey,4,3,4,The class is super engaging - might be diff now it isn't moisey though - I really liked the content but beware there's a 20 page paper which is kind of difficult to pull together so it's not completely easy,COML 2000,318
Andrew Moisey,5,4,4,"Definitely not the lightest class that you could take to fulfill requirements (I'm a CS major), but super interesting class. It does a broad survey of a bunch of different topics from philosophy of perception/seeing and important visual and aesthetic developments. For me, it really opened up my mind to different topics, and I wish I took it earlier! I did take it during SP20 though, so the class was definitely made easier towards the second half of the semester.",COML 2000,318
Andrew Moisey,5,3,3,"This was a great class! Lots of readings, but it was all interesting and worthwhile because they want you to succeed.",COML 2000,318
Andrew Moisey,5,3,3,"Fantastic professor (Moisey), exposes you to a diverse set of readings. Wish the discussion section was more of a discussion rather than a recap of course material, but can understand that given it is an introductory level class.",COML 2000,318
Andrew Moisey,4,2,2,"This class indeed gave me very interesting insight on how visuals are important to shaping people's perceptions; however, I was a bit distracted whenever the professor walked around the lecture room teaching to engage all of the students in all sides of the room. Sometimes the professor can be confusing, and it was helpful when the TA helped to clarify certain terms during discussion. The professor is really nice, but I guess his teaching style doesn't suit my learning style. I would say the terms get a bit complicated to understand because it can get a bit philosophical and very particular with wording, so it is helpful to clarify terms with the TA. The midterm and final is super straightforward, it's open notes, so as long as you got all the notes with you in class, you will pass, but the exception with the notes is you cannot print lecture slides. There is also one research paper that you get the whole semester to work on, so if you do bad on it, it's on you. The first half of the semester is not as interesting as the 2nd half of the semester, so just a heads up! I would say Professor Moisey is a LOT more interesting in lecturing on a talk he gave on the American",COML 2000,318
Andrew Moisey,4,2,2,"I took it Spring 2018 with Professor Moisey. The lectures and material were super interesting and there wasn't really  any homework besides the research paper due at the end of the semester which you'll get a great grade on if you start it early/talk to your TA about it. The exams are short-answer questions, as long as you look at the slides/get lecture notes you should do fine on them (they're open-notes!).",COML 2000,318
Tom McEnaney,-,2,-,Professor Monroe is great and very knowledgable but the course is EXTREMELY reading heavy. Sometimes we had to read an entire book in a week.

Anindita Banerjee,5,1,3,"100% recommend taking. The class is a great mix of different types of students from different majors. Your grade is based on attendance, participation, 2 group presentations, and a final project or essay which is completely open ended. Prof Banerjee sets up the class to encourage discussion. You read a bunch of different and cool sci fi texts, along with some great movies such as Blade Runner and The Hunger Games. Banerjee sometimes goes on hard to follow tangents, but really they aren't crucial.",COML 2035,321

My class was predominantly non-humanities majors, so there were a lot of interesting perspectives which the professor always tried to bring into the discussion. Well selected texts on their own and in comparison, and Prof. Banerjee has a great deal of passion and clearly knows her area of study deeply. Class discussions always brought in new and interesting aspects. When I took it there were no prelims, no papers, just group projects, presentations and discussions and an open-ended final project.

There are three main units. Each one ends with a speech you have to present to a small group of your peers. I thought the speeches would be nerve wrecking, but Jodi is very efficient at preparing us and a very lenient grader. It is a very easy course if you come to class and lab and pay attention. Really not that much work outside of the speeches and there are only three.

Peter Enns,5,1,2,Both Enns and Schuldt taught this class when I took it and I loved it! The professors are so good and very clearly understand what was going on. You really get to research whatever you want and it is so cool to get to submit a question to a national poll. The workload is not bad either but you do have to do the readings and answer a daily question.,COMM 3189,334
Brooke Duffy,4,3,3,This is a pretty easy class but super similar to a lot of other INFO course. Communication and Technology and Computing Cultures are essentially the same information. If you haven't taken those this course is great and you'll learn a lot about how media has impacted society and culture.,COMM 3200,335
Brooke Duffy,3,1,2,"I literally did not learn a single thing in this class and I would 100% not recommend taking this if you've already taken INFO 2450 (communication and technology). However, if you're looking for an easy elective for info sci, then this is a good option. Papers are 5 pages doubles spaced, but they're reflection papers so it's not that hard. Exams are exactly what's on the study guides. Another downside is mandatory attendance and assigned seating.",COMM 3200,335
Gilly Leshed,2,4,5,"I thought this class had so much potential, but I was really disappointed in Professor Leshed. I found her incredibly standoff-ish and confrontational when students asked questions. She doesn't encourage learning and never answers questions in an understanding and sympathetic way.  As well, I have found the value of the subject area drowned out by the excessive work that is assigned. The class is a single, extended group project, but each section of the project is incredibly time intensive and there is a lot of subjectivity in the grading.",COMM 3450,336
Gilly Leshed,5,3,5,"I really like this class! The workload is quite hearty with all the individual and group assignments. BUT, Gilly is a really passionate instructor and I learned a lot from the class regarding HCI and design process. I ended up putting the group project in my portfolio. I would encourage all design students to take it!",COMM 3450,336

Gilly Leshed,4,2,4,This class is really cool and a good introduction to Product Design. I was able to learn about the whole design process which helped me a lot with giving me a foundation in Product Design thinking. There's a lot of work though but it's worth it if you enjoy design.,COMM 3450,336
Qian Yang,4,1,2,I’m taking it with prof yang and it’s a pretty fun class if your group is collaborative!! It depends more on the group you have for the semester than the lecturer. You also have weekly meetings with the TA on your progress which is nice.,COMM 3450,336

Gilly Leshed,4,2,4,A must take design course at Cornell if you want to do HCI or UX in the future. Lecture is not so engaging but I really like the group project.

Can definitely be time consuming but if you got good teammates and a unique project idea the problem will be solved.,COMM 3450,336

Gilly Leshed,1,1,5,"The instructor is Gilly but Yang Qian hosted half of the class. Gilly didn't know how to use Figma so she asked her TA to help out. But my TA rarely speaks and kept saying ""cool"", ""great"". If I were not a UX designer already, I would struggle with this class, because the final project is making a Figma hi-fi prototype.",COMM 3450,336
Gilly Leshed,5,3,5,"If you have any career aspirations of working in UX Research or Product Design this is the class to take at Cornell. Gilly is a kind encouraging professor who gives clear, concise, and informative lectures. This course teaches you the important theoretical underpinnings of user experience design and gives you a formal language to ground one's design decisions. If you work hard on the group project, you can have a great portfolio piece by the end. However, I strongly recommend taking a course in visual design and using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, etc prior  to this course (i.e Intro to Digital Product Design). One criticism I have is that TA grading seems haphazard sometimes overly critical. There is a lot of busy work involved, but it is the difference between good and bad design.  Any negative reviews for this course is straight cap",COMM 3450,336
Gilly Leshed,5,2,4,"Took this class over summer of 2020 so instruction was online and asynchronous. Because of this the paper prototypes and user interviews were also conducted online. A semester's worth of material is condensed into around 2 months so the workload was not light. There were daily writing prompts, weekly projects, and group meetings very weekend. The material was easily digestible, despite each project taking a fair amount of time to complete, and the course TAs were very responsive and modified the syllabus to fit the overall situation.",COMM 3450,336
Gilly Leshed,5,3,5,"This class is a ton of work, but I loved it! It's a great introduction to HCI, and you definitely learn a ton as the semester project takes you through the entire design process. I've seen mixed reviews about this class, but I really believe that it's what you make of it. If you don't put in the work or you slack, you're not going to do well. But if you're genuinely interested in learning the content and working with your group members, you'll have a great time. Expect to put in a ton of work though as the milestones for the project often involve very lengthy reports.",COMM 3450,336
Gilly Leshed,3,2,4,"Your experience with this class will be very team-dependent (which is chosen by random at the beg of the semester). Lectures were dry and can probably be taught in 15 min (instead of 75 min) but the discussions were actually fun and used the HCI methods taught in class. Each component of the semester project contained an excessive amount of writing (almost as much as a technical writing course) and interviewing, but my group didn't find it difficult to score well on the project.  I recommend this class if you need it for fulfilling INFO requirements and for boosting your grade",COMM 3450,336
Gilly Leshed,3,3,5,"I was actually really excited to take this class, but Gilly made the experience pretty awful. Her lectures were extremely boring, and she is confrontational around students. She doesn't allow any laptops or phones in class at all. The assignment instructions are about 5 pages long and extremely detailed, and the grades are really harsh if you miss one tiny detail from the instructions.",COMM 3450,336
Gilly Leshed,1,3,5,"Do not take this class if the instructor is Gilly Leshed. She never provides clear instructions on assignments and projects, gives extremely boring lectures, and is often confrontational when someone proposes a suggestion or comment on how the class is run (terribly, btw). The grading is so inconsistent and subjective so you could be working your ass off and so get points taken off for really ridiculous things. Not worth the time at all",COMM 3450,336
Francois Guimbretiere,-,4,-,"This is the most useful class you'll take at Cornell, especially if you're looking to go into UX. I've never felt so qualified to do anything after taking a class, but I feel like I could actually conduct user research or design an app now.The only drawback is that every project is a group project, even the so-called ""individual"" ones, and like every group project, bad members can hold you back. The assignment prompts can be a little confusing, so make sure every member of your group understands what needs to be done so there are no surprises when grades come back. Prof Leshed is a great teacher, though, so don't let the group work deter you!",COMM 3450,336
Francois Guimbretiere,-,3,-,"This is the absolute best class to take if you are interested in UX/product design or user research in any way. It's definitely not an easy A so be prepared to work and learn a ton. Professor Leshed is a terrific lecturer who is always super organized and excited about her work. Grades are based primarily on the group assignments which really rests on who you end up with (groups are randomly formed) but are not bad at all if you get started early and have at least one person who's passionate about design in your group. My only complaint would be that assignments sometimes seem to be pretty tedious and not really reflective of how user-centered design is done in the industry (for example, for one part of an assignment we had to make a paper stop motion video of our app AND THEN redo it digitally like c'mon). Overall though, an excellent class if you put in the work or are not too concerned with grades. Either way you'll learn a bunch",COMM 3450,336
Francois Guimbretiere,-,4,-,"This class is one of the best classes I've taken at Cornell. The content is incredibly useful for people interested in design and UX.

However, homework assignments are still sometimes fairly tedious and annoying.",COMM 4400,338
Gilly Leshed,5,2,4,"A really interesting class if you're really into design theory and HCI and have exhausted every other HCI class lol. I feel like other classes like HCI Studio with Francois teach the same thing over and over again but this class really goes into abstract design methods (feminist design, ethnographic studies, undesign, etc.) that you may not use in industry but are still super interesting to learn about. I'd stay away if this is your first design class though because most of the work is readings and designing a project that may or may not exactly be an app/website. Gilly is one of the most organized professors I've ever met and she's super knowledgable!",COMM 4400,338

He always posts everything on his website and tells you exactly what needs to be done to succeed on all of the assignments, labs, and exams. The consultants are also great, but make sure to go to them NOT when assignments are almost due as you will likely not be helped for 1-2 hours. The work itself is great if you're truly interested in CS or just want a solid introduction to CS/software development, and I recommend you put in as much effort as you can to truly learn the material as this is foundational knowledge that is extremely relevant in future CS coursework, CS research, and real-world software engineering.

Anne Bracy,4,4,3,I think due to the fact many students go in with some computational background it is very easy to continuously find yourself preforming below average if you do not have this. That being said there is opportunity for you to regain some of this through partnered projects. If you do not have any experience I highly suggest you find yourself a slightly more experienced partner. The projects are the most difficult part,CS 1110,347

Kit-Yee Daisy Fan,5,2,4,"Loved Daisy Fan. She is super passionate about the class, and you can see her enthusiasm during lectures. Prelims are super fair (which is great since the class is not curved). Prelims are fairly simple, testing basically what we were taught (and this is coming from someone with no comp sci background whatsoever). Projects can get pretty brutal though, having a partner is usually a good option. But there's a LOT of help available, with consulting hours Sunday through Thursday, 4.30pm-9.30pm in addition to TAs' and professors' office hours. Highly recommend.",CS 1112,348
Kit-Yee Daisy Fan,5,3,4,"I really enjoyed this class. I was worried because I had no prior experience coding whatsoever, but Professor Fan is really good at explaining things and goes at a pace that is fast enough to be interesting, but slow enough so you can thoroughly understand the material. The projects are pretty difficult and consulting hours are typically very crowded, so start early and/or be prepared to wait a bit to get help. However, the TAs and consultants are extremely helpful. The prelims are very fair and you have ample study material; three practice prelims are provided, and going through all the lecture material and exercises and re-doing all the examples done in class was beneficial to me. Overall, this was a very fair class and I feel like anyone could do well as long as they put some work into doing the projects and studying for prelims.",CS 1112,348
Kit-Yee Daisy Fan,5,3,3,"I love Prof.Fan, she explains things really well. The class might be hard for coding-beginners, I would recommend for ppl to focus on the problem-solving thinking at the beginning and then go into detail on the syntax. GO TO CONSULTING HOURS they are sooo helpful.",CS 1112,348
Walker White,5,3,3,"Walker is an incredible teacher! He is so kind and really cares about helping his students, especially during class. Since it's under 50 students, he and the TA's are able to walk around and help us with the labs during class. He is great at email response time, and posts the slides for us to refer to throughout the semester.",CS 1133,349

Office hours are incredibly helpful and feedback from TAs are super friendly. Highly recommend!",CS 1300,350
Kyle Harms,4,2,3,"I liked the asynchronous nature of this class and the amount of flexibility professor Harms gives with his slip days. We got two slip days for every assignment which was invaluable. At times, the work got a bit tedious (especially filling out design journeys) but it was overall a good class if you want to learn HTML, CSS, and even a bit of javascript.

You leave the class understanding very basic design practices (user interviews, color choices, information display) though. Very easy class but make sure you are on top of deadlines, read the instructions thoroughly, and complete all the write-ups to the best of your ability.

Kyle Harms,5,1,2,"This is a really great class! Kyle definitely holds your hand a bit, but it's a great GPA boost. You learn a ton and you learn it well, it's not information that I've just forgotten since the class. There are three individual projects and one final group project with randomly assigned groups in your discussion section - I would recommend making some friends in you section so you can request them. A milestone for each project is due every week, so the projects never feel like a lot of work because it is impossible to put them off. The grading is super lenient, even if you are not the best designer, if you can explain your choices the way he teaches you to, you'll do very well.",CS 1300,350

I've never coded in my life and I'm just now switching to info sci as a sophomore, but I found the class perfectly organized, easy and I learned so much! I'm really going to miss him.

I learned most of the coding from TAs and on my own online and felt sometimes like this should have been a 4 credit class, but it wasn't too bad. If you have any basic coding exposure going into this class at all, you will do fine. I believe most people averaged in the A-range. Attendance was mandatory (taken by doing a written assignment on an index card and handing it in) but we got 6 skip days, which was great.",CS 1300,350

David Gries,3,3,2,"Took with David Gries in F19, and the class is not too exciting as it just goes through basics of java and object oriented programming. Took in person, and assignments take max a few hours. Lots of office hours support, and prelims are fine, just go to lectures. Go through past prelims as the prelims are very similar.",CS 2110,356
David Gries,5,3,3,All the class materials and resources were very accessible and nicely organized &amp; presented. Biweekly quizzes were sometimes challenging but the assignments were fair. Profs. Gries and Muhlberger are both awesome and I learned a lot!,CS 2110,356
David Gries,3,3,3,p nice!,CS 2110,356
David Gries,4,3,2,"Dr. Gries and Dr. Muhlberger were great. Lectures were clear and easy to follow. JavaHyperText is super useful. Beware: this class has a reputation of being ""easy"", but you get out of it as much as you put into it. The concepts are important for technical interviews. Do the reading and take notes! Don't skip lectures, especially in the latter half of the semester!",CS 2110,356
David Gries,5,3,2,"I found the lectures to be interesting and the assignments were short but instructive. Lectures were recorded on Panopto, I found some of their explanations to be confusing or lacking so rewatching or going to OH was helpful. Literally if you have any issue at all just go to OH and the answers will almost be fed to you. Gries isn't the best at explaining; the co-professor Curran Muhlberger was amazing at explaining things though",CS 2110,356
David Gries,2,3,3,"I personally did not find the content to be that engaging outside of some of the topics at the end of the course (such as Trees/Graphs and DFS/BFS). Concurrency/Theory of OOP in particular were not that interesting to me. That being said, I do think the assignments were worthwhile, and I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn more about Computer Science. Just don't expect this to be the holy grail of CS as it was described to me (though, tbf, I also don't do well with online education so take my review with a grain of salt).",CS 2110,356

David Gries,-,2,-,"Class was pretty straightforward, in many ways just a direct duplication/slight extension of concepts covered in AP CS. Gries is one of the most committed professors and while he may be difficult if you ask questions that he deems to be unimportant, if you actually seek him out and demonstrate a willingness to learn, he is truly fantastic. I stopped attending lectures after week 2, I definitely think you can look at the syllabus and just go to lectures on concepts you aren't familiar with.",CS 2110,356
David Gries,-,4,-,"Learned a lot in this class but the exams were pretty challenging. Assignments were doable if you start early. The semester I took it (Spring 2016), Gries curved it so low that even if you were at the mean raw score for the class you ended up with a C+. I don't think it's happened in other semesters but that really sucked.",CS 2110,356
David Gries,-,3,-,"The content is extremely interesting and important - loved the course content. However, the structure isn't really a structure. The class is very disorganized and the content is spread in different places, with no clear grading guidelines. Piazza is unhelpful and Gries can be condescending. I would have had the best time if the course was better structured. You basically teach yourself everything.",CS 2110,356
David Gries,-,2,-,"If you took 1110 and did decent the first half of 2110 is basically reviewing what you learned in Python and is really easy. The projects are also relatively low in terms of time commitment and difficulty. If you did not enjoy 1110 and don't have to take 2110, don't do it because it's not super interesting compared to 1110. If you took MATLAB before 2110, expect this class to be hard for you. Also, if you take this class you can understand the Gries memes so why not!",CS 2110,356
David Gries,-,3,-,"Gries lectures weren't very helpful. The first half of the class is learning to use java syntax instead of python/matlab. Second half of the class I found to be very interesting. Prelims can be difficult, best way to study for them is by doing practice prelims as the types of questions and formats generally don't change.",CS 2110,356
David Gries,-,3,-,"I took this in Spring 2016. Content itself is very useful for the computer science major as it is the foundation of all interviews. However, I found the projects to be tedious and useless, and lectures were extremely boring with Foster and Gries.",CS 2110,356

David Gries,5,1,1,You don't actually have to do any work. Gries taught it himself and was very open to questions. When we had large assignments he even brought in more Tas to help. Attendance was never enforces.,CS 2111,357
David Gries,5,1,1,"If you are looking for extra coverage or additional help on the topics covered in CS 2110 this is great. Gries covers the concepts more in-depth by going over some examples and also clarifies some when students ask a question. This is more class-like than office hours as it is not designed for individual help. Also, this is an awesome opportunity to get to know Gries better as the class was fairly small.",CS 2111,357
David Gries,5,1,1,"An excellent supplement to 2110, Gries teaches you concepts more in-depth and includes topics not covered in class. It prepares you above and beyond for the prelims and it gives you a chance to get to know Gries, there are typically 20-40 students compared to the hundreds of students in 2110",CS 2111,357
Dexter Kozen,-,1,-,"It's not about the points. One of the most meaningful CS classes you'll ever take, with lots of real projects instead of the fill-in-the-blank stuff you typically get at this level. Kozen is great.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,-,4,-,"Kozen is a really great professor and the course is also interesting, you need to write an online program for the final project with almost no start code. It's been less intensive this year since we could form a team with three students, but it's still the course I spent the most time in.",CS 2112,358

Dexter Kozen,3,5,5,Too much work,CS 2112,358
Dexter Kozen,5,5,5,"Took it with Kozen. If you can tackle this class, you can tackle almost every CS class. I would say it's more work than CS 2802 and CS 3110 combined. The median was A-, so most students ended up with an A- or above. Do not take this class if you don't already know Java (this class DOES NOT teach Java)",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,-,4,-,"I took this class with Professor Kozen in Fall 2018. Takes a ton of time (20+ hours per week), but you will learn a lot, especially from Kozen's lectures and the amount of content necessary to complete each project. I especially enjoyed how the class was less about Java and more about programming concepts in general - that said, it will greatly help you to be comfortable with Java before you start. One tip: Be very careful of who you choose for your partner when you are able to have a choice - this class is already time-consuming, so choosing the wrong person will dramatically increase the amount of work required.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,-,5,-,"I wouldn't advise taking it if you do feel confident in Java unless you are taking a really light workload.  If you feel strong in Java then it will still be a significant amount of work, but can definitely be managed.  Make sure to find good partners for partner projects, because soloing the assignments (while definitely possible for certain people), is a generally bad idea.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,-,2,-,"Be prepared to tackle real projects in this class. Unlike 2110, it will not hold your hand.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,5,4,5,"CS 2112 is a challenging course. You should come in knowing how to program in Java. Expect to work with a codebase with thousands of lines of code as the semester moves along. The first project is much easier than the later projects, and is not a good indication of the general difficulty of the assignments. For group projects, make sure to pick a reliable partner or partners and maintain open lines of communication.  That being said, I had a lot of fun in the class. The TAs and Professor Myers were knowledgeable, and always willing to help. The lectures were phenomenal. Moreover, the difficulty of the assignments and the depth and breadth of the material covered in lectures will prepare you for future CS courses, and the exams were graded very quickly.",CS 2112,358
Dexter Kozen,5,4,4,"If you know JAVA coming in, take this class instead of 2110. Currently a senior CS major and this class is still the best class I've ever taken. The projects were time consuming but extremely useful. Take this class with an otherwise light schedule freshman year and you are set to be a successful CS major. Tests are easy and you'll get a good grade.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,-,5,-,"Took this class with only AP CS background, didn't go to a single office hours, skipped most labs and recitations. Still did decently well. This class will require a lot of work, but is absolutely doable for anyone interested in CS. Very rewarding, although it will not feel that way during the course.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,-,4,-,"Very dependent on your partners, class was recently changed so that all of the assignments are partner work except for the first. Class is difficult, but worth it because Kozen is an amazing human being and the assignments are interesting and challenge you. (He basically has said that if you put effort into it, he'll make sure you won't get lower than a B- if that's a concern.) The workload is manageable, but you should have a good understanding of Java and start early.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,-,5,-,It's really worth it to take this class. A lot of software development related stuff is not taught until some 5000 level classes.,CS 2112,358
Dexter Kozen,-,5,-,"Definitely take this class if you are on the edge between 2110 and 2112 and are interested in computer programming (this is a must). Kozen's lectures are easy to understand, yet don't extend much beyond the online notes (which is what the prelims/finals are based on). Prelim/Finals are a joke if you go to lecture / read the notes / study reasonably, but the projects are a different story. These are very challenging and time consuming, yet super rewarding. Would probably be very hard without prior java experience. TA's and staff are SUPER helpful so you might as well try! Class gets curved up and the easy prelim/final factor disproportionately highly into your grade even if your projects suck. Also nothing attendence wise is mandatory.",CS 2112,358
Nate Foster,5,4,4,"Nate Foster is an incredibly enthusiastic, engaging, and passionate professor. The assignments are easily the best part of the course. They are challenging and give you a chance to work on projects with much larger scales than you are probably used to. Unfortunately your enjoyment of this course can be greatly affected by the ability of your partners. Although my partners were good, I heard several horror stories of absent and unhelpful group members.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,5,3,5,Take it. One of the best cs classes you will take at college. Myers is such an amazing lecturer. Heavy workload but you will enjoy it.,CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,3,4,5,"With the biweekly assignments, the workload was more than all my other classes' combined when I took this in freshman year. One positive is that it does force you to learn the material more deeply compared to CS 2110. The lectures are usually clear but incomplete, so reading the provided lecture notes is required to learn the material. Would recommend only if you want this class to be your main activity of the semester.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,1,5,5,"Under Andrew Myers, this class is definitely not for the faint of the heart. I took this class during FA21, and it burnt me out completely. If you really really like coding and spending 90% of your time doing so, you'll enjoy this class. I wouldn't recommend it for the average person, however. It's an immensely difficult and time consuming class and you definitely have to know Java + have significant prior coding experience to taking it",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,5,5,5,"(Fall 2019) Very difficult class, but worth it if you care about the subject.",CS 2112,358

Andrew Myers,3,3,3,Difficult course but you’ll learn a lot about Object Oriented programming and how to think as a programmer. The projects are very open ended and you will probably spend a lot of time planning before writing code. Myers is a great professor and it’s definitely worth taking because the content and experience you gain is very valuable.  Just be ready to sacrifice a lot of your free time (but you’re probably a CS major if you’re considering taking this and have no social life anyways so it’s no big deal).,CS 2112,358

Andrew Myers,4,4,5,I had transfer credit for 2110 but still did poorly in this class due to poor time management. Don't take it unless you're ready to drop 20 hours of your week on projects. I was grateful to be very comfortable in Java.,CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,5,2,4,"Lectures were interesting and informative and the class was organized very well. But most of the learning comes in the assignments, which require a lot of coding and self-teaching. This class teaches you how to design projects and write good code, not just course material that you forget in a month",CS 2112,358
Dexter Kozen,5,4,5,"Kozen is great.  Loved taking it with him, and found the course well organized and expectations clear.  Lots of work hours which really cements your understanding.  Honestly the material itself isn't that hard keeping in mind that it is an honors class.  It is worth knowing that 2110 and 2112 usually work together to make it easy to transfer between the two courses.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,4,4,5,I totally bombed this class but I think it might have been worth it lmao,CS 2112,358
Dexter Kozen,4,5,5,"Professor Kozen introduced the class with a picture of a cruise ship and a speed boat - one was labeled 2110 and the other 2112. I spent over 30 hours per week on this course and earned a B in the class. However, I have no regrets about taking it. It has been over 3 years since I took it but I have used the programming skills and concepts that Kozen taught me in every other CS class I have taken to date. In summary, much harder and more rewarding than a non-honors course.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,4,5,5,"This class was both very challenging and time-consuming. However, it does have projects where you build the entire system yourself, especially the final project that spans half the semester. The pace is also much faster than 2110 and the material is more in-depth. Myers is a very good lecturer and teaches the material well. Be sure to choose, preferably know how they work, good partners before finalizing groups for the final project, they will make or break the class experience.",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,2,5,5,"I actually dropped the class at the last day I could before getting a W. This is probably one of the best (if not the best) CS classes for understanding what development is. You learn how (read: are forced) to implement all aspects of software dev, from original ideas and design to debugging  and using your IDE to its maximum potential. However, the class is HARD. If you even think you can procrastinate, you're done for. The first project doesn't tell you anything about the difficulty. If you struggle on the first project, drop immediately. On the first 2 or 3 projects you can get away with putting things off a little, but starting with project 2, it gets hard fast. If you already have significant experience writing code and debugging (in Java), or if you are REALLY self-motivated and able to learn FAST, I definitely recommend taking this class. It will prepare you for the rest of the CS major (and probably your career) better than any other class. If you're one of those students who wants all As or is worried about grad school and need that 4.3 GPA, don't bother with this class. You take this because you want to (a) learn about the software dev process, (b) make great",CS 2112,358
Andrew Myers,5,5,5,"This has been one of my favourite CS classes at Cornell so far - Professor Myers is an amazing lecturer (I don't think I missed a single lecture), and you learn tonnes about creating a large project from scratch and making important design decisions. There's also some extra topics covered compared to 2110 here and there that are all technically covered in higher level courses, but it's super helpful to get to know them early on. The assignments take around 15 hours a week, you need to get started early. I also highly recommend going to Professor Myers' office hours, he's super nice and you pick up a lot of interesting stuff.",CS 2112,358

The course content itself isn't too difficult (almost the same as 2110), but the projects were a LOT of work. I think it's pretty manageable, though, as long as you're not doing too much outside of this class.

I didn't really learn much data structures because my partner and I put 40+ hours each week into the critter world projects. However, the connections you make in the class were worthwhile and it forces you to develop a good work ethic. I went into the class with only AP CS knowledge so I spent a huge amount of time learning/debugging the projects.

Kyle Harms,4,3,3,"Took the class with Professor Harms. Good lecturer but the lectures are very slow and structured. Overall the class is pretty good an introduction to backend web development. The class covered mostly PHP and SQl but you needed to use HTML, CSS, and JS to do the assignments. There weren't any prelims or a final for the class but there was a milestone or a final submission due each week that took a decent amount of time. You could definitely take INFO 2300 without INFO 1300 as long as you are somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS but the first assignment will be painful.",CS 2300,359

I felt like I was drowning just trying to get the HW done for the weekly deadlines. HW always required OH for me, and OH were often PACKED. They seriously need a bigger room for it, people ended up sitting on the floor/standing because there were no chairs left. I came into this class with no background in theoretical/proof math or competition math, which sorely hurt I think. Tried to get partial credit on exams but still did poorly on them and ended up dropping the class. Definitely a weed out class for CS",CS 2800,361

The lectures are delivered in a sensible manner and his explanation is thorough; the textbook was almost completely absent from my routine but his online wiki more than make up for my learning process. However, the homework is cleverly written and a b**** to do, and the smug man knows it. It is absolutely the most difficult homework I have encountered at Cornell thus far and you are better off waiting for answers and explanations at OH than doing it with your partner or alone, and it doesn't help you to prepare for prelims and finals as those questions are hard but nowhere as tricky and tedious.

If you fall under these categories as I did, you are in for a ride. The psets were long and difficult, and almost always required you to go to OH. The prelims are difficult, my main objective at least was to get the most partial credit as possible because it was impossible for me to get full credit on any question.  There used to be a separate honors discrete class for those who already had a strong mathematical background, but without this class there were a lot of people ""breaking"" the curve because they already knew the material.

However, I feel like I gained much more from completing the homework and going to (too many) office hours than Professor George's lectures. On the bright side, there are many TAs available for this course, and I have had exceptional experiences with all but one of my office hour visits.

I wouldn't say that the material is difficult, the graders are just bad. They would acknowledge that your answer is correct but not give you the full credit because apparently it's not in the form that they wanted you to answer it. And as if that wasn't bad enough by itself they also make you type the answers because they can't be bothered reading the handwritten answers.

Michael Clarkson,5,4,4,BEST CS CLASS (a little bit of an exaggeration) Clarkson is GOAT and he teaches the class really well. OCaml is very different and not intuitive but the class was paced perfectly so that by the last programming assignment we could pull it off in one go. The final project was also great cause we had to code something from the scratch without any starter code.,CS 3110,364
Michael Clarkson,5,3,4,"Clarkson and Foster both do a great job of running this course/are very thoughtful and accommodating. I think the workload is relatively high (compared to the other core CS classes), but manageable? Basically an assignment every two-ish weeks and a final project for the last few weeks, and office hours can be pretty helpful if you can get a spot :)",CS 3110,364
Michael Clarkson,5,2,3,"This course really lives up to its reputation. Despite the unexpected difficulty of an asynchronous class, the courses were incredibly well organized with clean, fancy videos &amp; a information-rich wiki page. I could see that Clarkson was really passionate into what he's teaching, and that passion brought me to appreciate the materials. Since functional programming is a vital tool as a developer, this class also seems like one of the most valuable class in the CS requirements list, too.",CS 3110,364
Michael Clarkson,4,4,4,"To be honest, this class hasn't been very hard this semester, at least nowhere near as bad as the things I've heard. But I think some of that is probably because of COVID. The assignments still take a long time though, especially A3 and A4. But I like how he breaks them up into satisfactory, good, and excellent scope so you can choose how much you want to do. OCaml is pretty easy to pick up, and functional programming is actually kind of nice. Clarkson is pretty good at explaining concepts too, so overall, this class hasn't been bad at all.",CS 3110,364
Michael Clarkson,5,2,4,"The online format is extremely well organized and Professor Michael Clarkson is not only an amazing professor in terms of his ease of understanding and teaching style but extremely passionate and quirky guy.

OCaml has definitely changed how I think about programming, and I'm very grateful for the experiences this course gave me.",CS 3110,364
Michael Clarkson,3,4,4,"I took it Fall 2018, which I believe is the first semester that Clarkson switched his course to random project groups and weekly assignments (instead of like 2-week ones). Most people I knew agreed that this was a pretty heavy inconvenience because of scheduling concerns with people you don't know and the freeloader problem which Clarkson tried and failed to solve. His change to weekly assignments also makes sure that every week you have to spend a nontrivial amount of time on his assignments which can also be pretty annoying if you're not inherently interested in functional programming. I'm honestly not that interested in programming so a lot of the course was pretty boring for me personally. However, many people I knew found this part interesting so it depends on what you like. The proofs portion of his course was actually kind of interesting in hindsight (but in the moment it seemed like a pain). If you don't spend time trying to understand the course material and do major parts of the projects it will be difficult to get an A. But if you do those things, getting an A seems doable.",CS 3110,364

Walker White,5,3,5,"Far by one of the best courses I have ever taken as it is interdisciplinary with both programmers and designers so you get to experience working from different perspectives, quite enjoyable, and the work you put in really pays off. Took this class in Spring 2020 so the second half of the semester was spent online instead of in-person. Difficulty and workload is unique to each individual group. Each person is expected to contribute a reasonable amount but some students do more than necessary to refine their game. One thing I did not expect was the amount of writing and documentation that was required, but these documents are beneficial as they teach standard writing guidelines and even now I use the principles for writing my own documents.",CS 3152,365

David Mimno,-,2,-,"This class was very okay. Mimno won't be teaching it again, so I'm not sure how it will change, but when I took it it started slow with Javascript for loops and other basic stuff like that. There are multiple partner projects with randomly assigned students, and I had to carry both of my groups, which was extremely frustrating. One partner dropped out of the class a few days before the project was due after promising he was making progress on his work. By the end of the class, it was just D3. Honestly, I don't feel like I got a lot of value out of it and wouldn't recommend it. Charting isn't super interesting at this level and most of the class felt inconsequential.",CS 3300,366
Jeff Rzeszotarski,5,2,3,"The class with Jeff is amazing and definitely a good idea to take as a tech elective if you are CS.  It is really enjoyable and very interesting.  BUT it is not a class where you can just never pay attention and get an A but if you do pay attention and keep up with the work and lectures it is not that hard at all.  Weekly problem sets, weekly quizzes, a couple of group projects, and a take home final make up your grade.",CS 3300,366
Jeff Rzeszotarski,3,2,3,"Easy class. The weekly problem sets are similar to the lectures, and overall very interesting and fun. There are two group projects but the given time is relatively short so make sure to plan ahead. ",CS 3300,366

Jeff Rzeszotarski,4,4,4,Jeff is such a great professor! I really like the course structure: lecture +  coding demos. The content is also super organized and easy to understand.

Jeff Rzeszotarski,5,2,2,"I took this class with Rzeszotarksi (FA22) and the class was not super challenging. The professor gives you weekly coding assignments that generally follow the lectures so they are not super hard to complete. There are two group projects throughout the semester and a take-home final. The groups are randomly assigned so be aware of this. Overall, you learn a lot about d3 and Javascript and I think it was a great class to get you into making data visualizations. ",CS 3300,366

David Mimno,-,4,-,"David Mimno (Spring 2018). This course was boring and tedious and you don't learn much. He forces you to go to lecture with attendance index cards/Google forms and what he lectures about in class isn't relevant to the assignments. I don't think he understands D3 very well, so he isn't able to teach it well. He seems like he enjoys data science more because he was doing a lot of k means clustering and Naive Bayes in class. The grading is so arbitrary and biased on if you can make your project look good (good color scheme, good images, etc). The TAs just look at your project and give a grade with minimal explanation. The group projects are a great place to learn, but a lot of the time, one person ends up doing the whole thing.",CS 3300,366
Anne Bracy,4,4,4,"I took this class with Anne Bracy in the Fall of 2019. Generally, a solid class - Bracy's wonderful ability to give good lectures helped us understand many concepts with relative ease, and the projects were usually fun to work on. That said, it's a good amount of work - I would guess about 15 hours / week. Office hours and TAs are very helpful here if you get stuck. My one complaint about this class was the lack of a ""test harness"" to test our code on in a robust manner. I feel like this would have helped me learn a lot more from the projects if I had one.",CS 3410,367
Hakim Weatherspoon,3,1,1,"Nowhere near as bad as some of the horror stories had led me to believe. Projects were quite short and exams had tons of time so that no one ever had problems finishing. That said, the course was not as well organized as classes like 2110, 2112, or 3110, and some projects like buffer overflow probably could've benefited from a few more starter hints. If you played a lot of Minecraft, all your redstone knowledge will unironically help out a ton on the first half of the class. Overall, not the best class, but you'll survive.",CS 3410,367
Anne Bracy,4,3,4,"I took this class in the fall of 2022. Overall, not as bad as I expected. This course is very fast-paced and a lot of this class's content builds upon previously learned material so keeping up is a necessity. Bracy is an excellent lecturer, however, and I don't remember any lecture feeling boring or poorly structured. Because of that, I highly recommend going to lectures despite the slides being posted online. Side note, in my opinion, the recommended prerequisite of CS2024 isn't necessary at all. You'll learn all the C you need during this class.",CS 3410,367
Anne Bracy,4,5,5,"Definitely the most hours spent in any CS class (for me at least). Towards the end of the course you begin to feel the value of the course material, however the sheer amount of content covered on each exam is dizzying.

However, the content becomes much harder after the first prelim and you will have to dedicate a lot of time into learning the material. The projects were interesting (working with Logisim was very annoying but thankfully it is only used for the first two assigments) and Professor Bracy is very generous with slip days (6 for the semester with a maximum of 4 per assignment). Overall, a very difficult course, but I felt like I came out of it learning a lot.",CS 3410,367
Anne Bracy,3,4,4,"The material of the class is not as hard as you might heard of, but it's surely a lot of new terms/ works.

Anne Bracy,3,3,3,"Taking it Fall 2022. It's a solid amount of work, but the hardest part about the class is the exams. They are generally super long, and require you to have speed and accuracy with all the material. The tests make you think hard about the material and tend to have a couple questions that are extensions to the concepts/examples in class. The projects have been nerfed a bit in the past years, so they are not too hard, and are a great grade booster. The projects are also super cool, and you learn a lot about how a computer works inside and out (you even get to build your own processor and interpreter!). Very cool class, and Bracy was great.",CS 3410,367

Bracy is a nice professor who clearly puts a lot of effort into designing the course and keeping it up to date from semester to semester. The workload can be high particularly with the projects, but if you keep up with the course then the difficulty is very reasonable while being very interesting. Prelims can go over a lot of material and the questions  definitely test your understanding, so it's important to prioritize studying early for this class especially.",CS 3410,367

Anne Bracy,4,5,5,"Bracy is a good lecturer, but this class is very fast paced especially towards the middle of the semester. I found myself having to rewatch lectures because some of the concepts would go over my head the first time. The projects are very long and can seem very intimidating at first. The project write ups are also pretty vague which is why I think these assignments are harder than they need to be. Office hours are really crowded the week an assignment is due so start early if you know you're going to need help.",CS 3410,367
Hakim Weatherspoon,4,5,5,"I think the class is painful if you don't come into the class with any knowledge about digital logic/computer architecture. Overconfidence can be a real thing. But I thought the projects that came after the ALU and Mini-RISCV assignments were a lot of fun, I felt like I understood the purpose of this class a lot better after doing them. Weatherspoon doesn't have as much of a cult following as Anne Bracy, his pacing is a bit slow, he's hard to follow often, but at least he's awfully nice and caring. In my experience, if you stick it out in the class long enough you might eventually get to the point where you can understand his lectures better. I think his lectures would definitely benefit from being recorded like they were this semester. Also for Spring 2020 they heavily nerfed the base difficulty of the malloc project and killed the cache project altogether, really shows how nice the course staff is under the pandemic.",CS 3410,367

The ECE majors in the class seemed less prepared because some of them didn't even know Java before being thrown into C.",CS 3420,368
Nils Napp,3,3,4,I took this class SP 22 with Prof Napp. The course structure was basically flipped classroom where we were expected to watch lecture recordings and complete weekly quizzes. The labs &amp; project take up 60% and they are not easy but doable. Since there were no exams it was nice.,CS 3420,368
Nils Napp,3,3,3,"Class has been alright. Was taught asynchronous, and the lectures were decent, with weekly quizzes which were not very challenging. No exams, just labs, but the labs are confusing and hard.",CS 3420,368
Nils Napp,3,3,3,Professor Napp had prepared online videos and classes were done in a reverse classroom style. He responded relatively well to feedback from students but the material itself was hard to learn and connect directly to the labs.,CS 3420,368
Nils Napp,3,1,1,"Our semester was completely asynchronous, with weekly lecture quizzes for pre-recorded lectures. We also had no tests and only labs, which made this class almost no stress for this year. I can't say about other years in the future though.",CS 3420,368

Nils Napp,1,1,1,"This is by far the worst class I've taken at Cornell. Although this class was the most free and easiest class I've ever taken,  the lectures were quite terrible and the final project was poorly organized. I napped every time Prof Napp started to lecture and got my video watching participation just like that.",CS 3420,368
Nils Napp,2,3,3,"Not a great class. The professor is very new and seems disorganized. Grades consist of quizzes and labs, and lectures are a little hard to follow. Lab partners were assigned for everyone and kept for the whole semester, so if you had a bad partner you were stuck with them for almost all the labs.",CS 3420,368
Nils Napp,5,3,3,"I really enjoy 3140 with Professor Napp. It doesn't deserve all the hate that it gets. The quizzes are really straight forward and based on the slides, and the labs (while slightly difficult) are very insightful and there are plenty of office hours to get your code looked over and fixed. Most of the complaining I hear is from long office hour lines for the day before and day that the labs are due, since everyone leaves it for last minute.",CS 3420,368
Jose Martinez,2,4,3,"I did not like this class. Martinez taught lecture ok enough, but the prelims were really unfair. He did not even give our prelims back. You had to go to office hours to see them. I think he just reuses the same prelims. The labs were fine. A little difficult, but nothing outside of lab work for similar classes.",CS 3420,368
Edward Suh,5,3,4,"Took this class with Professor Nils Napp. The most challenging part was definitely the labs. Exams and homeworks were pretty straightforward, and the homeworks were not too time consuming. For the labs, make sure to get started early, as debugging takes a lot of time. Also, try to find a good partner that you work well with, as that really helps. Go to office hours to help debugging get done quicker. This is a very useful class in embedded systems, and the knowledge will really help if you go into embedded programming in industry.",CS 3420,368
Jose Martinez,-,4,-,"Lectures were pretty dull and difficult to sit through, and for me the exams required a lot of memorization. There's a lot of overlap with CS 4410, but otherwise I didn't find the content that interesting.",CS 3420,368
Edward Suh,-,3,-,Took with Ed Suh in Spring 2018. Class is not too hard and homeworks are relatively straightforward.

Adrian Sampson,5,4,3,"Sampson is an amazing lecturer -- great at explaining the material in a captivating manner and has an amazing ability to answer questions in a clear and concise manner. The course focuses on formalizations of programming languages and type systems, which contains lots of discrete mathematics. The assignments are challenging and push you but are satisfying once completed. Assignments and prelims are hard because they push you to do things you haven't done in class and because the formal nature of things forces you to be 100% to get correct. Would highly recommend if you would like to take a very interesting course that deepens your CS knowledge in profound ways, especially if you liked 2800 and 3110.",CS 4110,369
John Foster,4,3,4,"Took it under Nate Foster. It was a pretty interesting class. You learn about the foundations of programming languages, and after taking the course, you will be at least moderately confident in building your own programming language. Homeworks can get very theoretical, but there's the occasional coding assignment thrown in (we use OCaml). The class has an open ended final project. Problem sets can get tricky for some topics but mostly manageable.",CS 4110,369
John Foster,5,4,3,"Nate Foster is amazing. If you liked CS 2800 and CS 3110, you will love this class because it's basically a mesh of those 2 classes.",CS 4110,369
John Foster,4,4,3,"The professor is Nate Foster (not John as the tag states below), and he was very engaging to the class during his lectures. The course material is very interesting, if you're interested in the theory and logic behind programming languages. Lectures are a little fast, so it is good that notes are released beforehand and lectures are recorded. The homework is a bit challenging but not too long or frequent. The exams are challenging (probably a step up from the homework) but interesting. The final project allows you to apply what you've learned in class and go above and beyond This class isn't for everybody but for people interested in PL and/or enjoy making inductive proofs, I highly recommend!",CS 4110,369
Andrew Myers,5,5,5,"The class is pretty hard and definitely a lot of work. You will learn a lot though, and Meyers is a great lecturer.",CS 4120,370
Andrew Myers,5,5,5,"Myers is an amazing lecturer -- probably the best lecturer I've ever had. He explains the material in depth, is clear and concise, and is clearly well organized and practiced. I found the content in this course to be the most interesting compared to any other CS topic I've come across. That being said, in order to get the most out of (and pass) this course, you must put in high effort and lots of time. The prelims cover lots of information because the lectures are high paced and Myers goes in depth about the material. The project is incredibly fun, especially with partners who are also hard working. Building the compiler took around 20+ hours per week per person which is a significant commitment in addition to homeworks and lectures. However this project causes you to grow in ways that nothing else at Cornell even comes close to. This class inspired me to become a Compiler Engineer after graduating (having built a compiler was a massive reason I got the job!). I would recommend this class to everyone -- the high commitment is easily worth what you will get out of this class. There is no class at Cornell that compares to this Course (in my opinion",CS 4120,370

Andrew Myers,4,5,5,"Professor Myers is great! He is a very engaging lecturer, and his course notes are very clear. Overall the class is very intense, but it is a very rewarding experience to get through. I think it's very important to go in with a team you know and have worked with before, just because each assignment is so intense. The TAs are all really knowledgeable and are very helpful - go to office hours a lot! I would highly recommend this class as a practicum.",CS 4120,370
Andrew Myers,5,5,5,"Professor Myers is really great, and the course is an incredible learning experience. Lectures are very thorough, sometimes fast-paced.

Walker White,4,4,5,"The class is a LOT of work, but is definitely worth it if you are passionate about game dev. You work very closely with your teammates and learn a lot about design/dev workflow. You also write a ton of documentation but that satisfies the communication requirement for engineering.",CS 4152,372
Walker White,5,3,4,It's just like 3152. Everything people said about the intro class applies equally to 4152; it's run almost the same way and has almost identical content (just using C++ and CUGL instead of Java and LibGDX).,CS 4152,372
Michael Clarkson,5,3,4,Clarkson is a great lecturer and the material covered is interesting. Assignments were manageable and mostly autograded; you would know if you had successfully completed all proofs before an assignment was officially graded or not. I would recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested and it was an enjoyable experience!,CS 4160,373
Michael Clarkson,5,2,2,"The best class I've ever had, point-blank. Don't worry if you're not a 'math person'! Fascinating course on type theory, verification, Coq, and functional programming. If you liked 3110, you'll probably like this class. You can also check 100% of the work you turn in - if you don't get a proof to compile, you won't get points for it. Exams were take-home proof assignments that tried to teach some small new concepts. Weekly assignments varied in length (2hrs-8hrs) but Clarkson tried to time them to fit the mood of the semester (slow in the beginning, a break over spring break). Even the longer assignments are made up of lots of smaller proofs, so the dopamine hits are fantastic. Clarkson cares a lot about his lectures, and it shows.",CS 4160,373
Michael Clarkson,5,2,3,"It's nice because the computer tells you unambiguously when you've correctly completed each part of the homework. Clarkson is a good professor, though I hear he isn't going to be teaching it in the future. Actually, this course probably won't even exist in the future.",CS 4160,373
Alexander Vladimirsky,4,5,5,"This class is  alot of work. Psets are a mix between proofs and matlab coding. They take quite long: 10-20+ hours. Exams were takehome when i took it. While the course says no pre reqs, it is quite hard if you dont know any diff eq beforehand. He does a lecture overview of diff eq (that covers like 50% of normal diff eq class). The professor is quite good however but you need to ask questions when lost otherwise it will be hard. The class usually has lots of grad/meng students. I learned quite a lot from this class though - would recommend if you are interested in the content - though it is a lot of work. I would say on a similar level as cs 2112.",CS 4210,374

There's a fair bit of work, and the median tends to be quite high due to the grad students that take this course, so be prepared for that.

The course overall is pretty light from the material itself to the assignments. The final project is a bit more demanding, but I agree with past reviews that it has taught me so much about what full-stack development actually looks like. DNM as a professor is also an engaging lecturer and just fun overall. The one thing I disliked was not having recorded lectures or posted notes for when I occasionally missed writing down something and couldn't refer to it anywhere.

Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,5,2,2,This class was one of the best classes I've taken at Cornell. The topic is very interesting and Prof DNM does a really good job explaining everything. He is an engaging lecturer and focuses on building your intuition around class topics so that you know how to apply the methods you learn. There are weekly assignments for the first half of the semester that are pretty straightforward and interesting. The second half of the semester revolves around creating your own recommendation system for pretty much anything you want. Prof DNM is also very fair in terms of grades. He really wants everyone to understand the material and succeed in the class. I would recommend taking this class if you have even the slightest interest in IR or NLP.,CS 4300,376
Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,3,2,1,"Class was generally interesting, but the lectures move really slowly and aren't that important in terms of learning the material.

Christopher Buckley,-,3,-,"I took the class in Spring 2018. The contents of the class were pretty useful and interesting, you come across these concepts in other classes such as NLP for example. I personally thought the assignments were well-designed and not too hard. There was a final group project (around 5 people per team) and how good the project goes will depend on the team you form. The class was definitely worth it, educational and also rewarding in terms of grades (as the median was an A).",CS 4300,376
Immanuel Trummer,3,3,2,"I took this class with Immanuel Trummer in Fall 2019. Like past reviewers, I agree that lecture is dry. Pacing is also somewhat odd - fast at times, slower at others - but is generally followable. The content of the course itself is somewhat useful , but I was disappointed to find out there is no coding in this class (unless you count SQL queries as ""coding""). The benefit of this is the vastly-reduced amount of work you have to do; when I took it, the only assignments that counted for a grade were 5 problem sets (really 4, your worst one is dropped), 1 prelim, and 1 final exam. It's overall an OK course - I just wish it could be taught in a more engaging manner than it currently is.",CS 4320,377
Immanuel Trummer,-,3,-,Taking this class with Trummer is extremely boring but the course material is useful for interviews and actually interesting if you can teach it to yourself. Halfway through the semester I stopped going to lecture. The exams were a valid test of knowledge and the homeworks weren't bad since you could work in groups and there were plenty of office hours. Overall a very average course. Would recommend to CS majors looking for another 4000 level elective. Curved to an A- so you can basically f up the midterm or final and still do okay which is nice.,CS 4320,377

Also, the exams are somewhat difficult given the little practice that we get to do.

Problem sets were fill in the blank PDF's autograded, so while you could request regrades it made homeworks more stressful.

It's kind of a double edged sword, though, since screwing up even one assignment can tank your grade. RVR and Schneider co-taught this course when I took it. RVR was super friendly and fairly engaging as a lecturer but it very quickly becomes clear that he has a ton of expertise in a very narrow range of fields, and whenever he needs to step out of that circle, he'll frequently trip over himself and get things wrong. Schneider, on the other hand, is a jerk, and delivers lectures with such a stupendous amount of dryness that I'd frequently find myself zoning out within minutes of lecture starting, despite spending concentrated effort to pay attention.

Robbert Van Renesse,4,3,4,"Technically Yunhao, a grad student, taught it the semester I took in FA20. A very project intensive but interesting class. You work on projects in EGOS, or the Earth and Grass Operating System, developed By Renesse. When I took it there were 5 homeworks, and you had a partner for the last 4. The projects were a queue, user threads, MLFQ, cache, and filesystem. Each was interesting and fair but also a  fair share of work. I would set up regular meeting times with your partner of about 2 hours each and you should be good. The only bad part was that grading came very late in the semester for projects, but I don't think anyone did devastatingly poorly and didn't expect it.",CS 4411,380

But overall great class, programmed a lot, and learned a lot.",CS 4411,380
Ken Birman,4,3,4,"I think this course is better taken after Operating Systems, even though it can technically overlap, to get the most out of the material. The lectures can feel somewhat disconnected sometimes, but the content is overall very interesting and super useful if you ever intend to do low-level programming. The programming projects were disorganized, in large part because the course is new, but very engaging ideas (such as implementing MapReduce). Workload was substantive, especially if you aren't as familiar with C++, but it is definitely doable without knowing much about it beforehand. The main drawback of this course is disorganization from it being new and from the professor, but the content and projects are great. ",CS 4414,381
Ken Birman,2,3,4,"Took this class in Fall 2021, the second time it was offered and the first time it was in person. Really hard to stay awake in class, but he also took attendance by passing around a sheet of paper that misses like half the audience and everyone has to go to the front at the end to sign in. Homework assignments are super long and disorganized and there are a ton of mistakes in them. They all involve C programming, which supposedly isn’t the focus of the class, yet exams test on super specific C knowledge anyway.",CS 4414,381
Ken Birman,3,4,2,"Being the first semester of the class, the course was disorganized to a certain degree; we got about just more than half of the assignment planned, and they also got changed a lot during the semester.

Rachit Agarwal,5,2,1,"I took the course SP20 and thought that Rachit was the best professor I've had at Cornell. He is a very entertaining lecturer, cares deeply about all of the students, provides ample opportunity for students to catch up if they fall behind, and is very lenient/fair with grades. The content is interesting and is delivered in a way that is easy to understand.  The workload is extremely low. Homeworks and projects are worth 0% of your grade and are really to help you learn the material. In class quizzes are easy if you attend lecture, and even if you don't, there is a grading option that also weighs quizzes as 0% of your final grade.  Overall great course with a great professor.",CS 4450,383
Rachit Agarwal,4,4,2,The professor is really passionate in class and really helpful in OH. Homeworks are optional but need to be done to do well on exams. Exams are open book but pretty difficult because the professor combines topics/ideas together in ways you haven't covered in class/on homework. ,CS 4450,383
Rachit Agarwal,5,3,1,"The course is very chill. For example, homework was optional. While Rachit always said you only needed to watch his lectures, I found it helpful to read the textbook. To do well on the exams, you will definitely want to study and do practice problems.",CS 4450,383
Rachit Agarwal,4,2,1,Professor is great and makes lectures very interesting. Homework is optional and needs to be reviewed+understood to do well on exams. Exams were unlimited time for most of the semester. Final exam was not given during the exam period and was not unlimited time which I thought was unfair since it limited study time.,CS 4450,383
Rachit Agarwal,3,4,2,"The course content is very interesting. You get to learn about how the internet works. The professor seems very passionate about the topic and knows his stuff. He tries too hard to be funny, often by cursing. Homework was optional, which made the course seem chill, but not really. Optional homeworks, unlimited time and open-book exams were really due to the lack of organization of the course and the course staff (professor included) not wanting/having the time for creating appropriate exams and grading homework. Your entire grade is based on exams, which makes it either really easy to get an A or really easy to fail. Other than the professor and the head TA, it was difficult to find help as many of the other TAs were also confused about the material or just recited the solution keys. Questions on Ed were often left unanswered. It's a pity because the topic is really interesting, but the course really needs better organization. ",CS 4450,383
Rachit Agarwal,5,3,1,"Rachit is a great professor in that he cares a lot.  I rated workload as 1 not because the class is a breeze necessarily but because the only work is prepping for the exams since the problem sets aren't graded.  As long as you pay attention and prep for exams well the tests are not terrible.  Also, apart from the grade aspect, the subject is really interesting and rachit is really passionate about students understanding it.",CS 4450,383

Abe Davis,3,4,4,"Definitely a more difficult class than I was expecting, but fascinating material. Be warned: there's lots of tricky linear algebra applications along the way here, and Davis is a newer professor who really means well but is still calibrating his teaching and assignments (as of fall 2021).

You need a working knowledge of linear algebra and some experience with numpy and Javascript to do well in this class. Definitely not as difficult as other graduate level classes.

They had a very low TA : student ratio, such that even in Dec, they weren't able to finish grading assignments that had been submitted in Sep.",CS 4620,384
Stephen Marschner,5,3,4,"Took it in Fall 2020 where the course was completely revamped. Material is a lot more accessible and understandable.

In the beginning the assignments were too difficult by far, but the professors adjusted to make it a feasible course.",CS 4620,384
Stephen Marschner,5,4,4,"I really enjoyed this class, despite the difficulty. For context, I took this class as a sophomore and found it challenging but super interesting. Many older students/graduate students take the course, so at times it does feel like you are starting behind others, but you really can just buckle in and do well.  Marshner is a great teacher and the projects are fun (when they're done).",CS 4620,384
Stephen Marschner,5,3,4,"One of the most interesting classes I took at Cornell. Assignments would often be difficult especially in the beginning, and definitely time consuming, but they were always doable. Professor Marschner is very nice and really smart. It's a lot of fun to feel like you're learning about the process of creating something you can see visually, and taken with the prac, it was very fun and rewarding to projects you can see and interact with. They are right when they say that the ""cool factor"" of this class is very high. I personally found the class extremely interesting, and am so glad I took it. It's not for everyone, but as someone who thought graphics were cool before hand, now I think it's something I want to continue pursuing. I highly recommend for anyone who might be interested.",CS 4620,384
Stephen Marschner,1,5,5,"Do not take this class. The professor and TAs are extremely unhelpful, the assignments are extremely confusing and time consuming, and the lectures are all numbers with no explanation.

It is hard and time consuming for no reason. DO NOT TAKE!",CS 4620,384
Stephen Marschner,2,5,4,"Very hard assignments, slides and lectures assume a huge amount of prior knowledge unfairly (especially linear algebra, which isn't even a prereq for the class for some reason), and even reading the textbook won't help you much since so many parts of assignments require knowledge outside of the textbook.

The finals syllabus wasn't put up until a day before, there was a last minute announcement about getting a calculator, there were 0 practice problems or sample papers available, and since the assignments were code-based, we did not know what to expect for the final. It is an absolute nightmare and a disgrace of the greatest magnitude to the CS Department that this class still exists. All that I learned was through the book myself.

The homework assignments never really helped me understand the material as they're a lot more about just running algorithms and a lot of counting. There's no coding at all, which I think could've been helpful. The prelim and semifinal were not well written and I do not feel like they tested my knowledge well.

The lectures are not the greatest and professor Hirsh will make some mistakes in presenting and end up confused. Homeworks are not hard but not 100% clear. Exams are fair and an okay amount of practice material is provided. The quality of the class is more dependent on the quality of the head TA and the rest of the course staff than on the professor.",CS 4700,386
Haym Hirsh,1,3,2,"I took this course with Hirsh FA19 and absolutely hated it. It was hard to follow lectures or learn from them in any way, and I relied on the TA's review slides right before exams to learn the material for the entire semester. The first half of the semester up until the midterm barely covered any material, and we only had one full homework assignment covering the material. This made it extremely difficult to be prepared for the exam. The second half of the semester covered significantly more information and suddenly had a homework assignment per week, but often were full of errors and poorly scheduled. I barely learned anything of importance in Artificial Intelligence, especially how to code anything covered.",CS 4700,386
Haym Hirsh,4,2,1,"This class gets bashed on because it is largely a ""get out what you put in"" situation. Haym is a brilliant guy--check out his background. While at times disorganized, he actually explains things really well, and you will realize that you learned a lot once the class is over.

Claire Cardie,1,4,4,"This class is highly disorganized, and it doesn't seem like the professor has a major hand on the course logistics. The projects are difficult not because of the content but because of the ambiguity in the description and the grading schema.

The grades and projects are never released on time, yet they still expect the students to somehow meet the deadline.",CS 4740,388

The lectures didn't prepare me for the projects at all. We went through algorithms in class but nothing about the implementation conventions. If you are not familiar with PyTorch and all those NLP packages, it will be a huge pain to search the documentation and often I didn't even know where to start because no one tells me what to look at. Thus, the projects are super time-consuming. I spent much more time on this class than on 3410 which is known for its heavy workload. Also, idk if it's bc the class is in the morning, the lecture is super dry and dead, the professor and the PhD lecturer really lack some enthusiasm in teaching and thus made the material much less engaging than it should have been.",CS 4740,388

CS 4740 was one of the classes that fit my schedule for Fall 2020 where I took this class online. Lectures were decent, but could be better, there was a technical microphone issue where the professor's audio was practically inaudible and students were not able to hear clearly. Project guidelines were long, open-ended, overly wordy, and required students to write tedious code that were not directly related to class material.",CS 4740,388
Claire Cardie,-,3,-,"I really regret taking this class over my other options. Prof. Cardie's lectures are almost entirely based on Jurafsky's textbook. The examples and figures in her slides are straight from that textbook, and thus you can skip most of the lectures if you just do the reading. Honestly, I think reading the textbook is the more efficient way to learn the materials since her lectures are poorly organized. She spends a lot of time explaining linguistics concepts but not enough time on math and algorithms. This is very troublesome if you have a big project team (3-4 people), because you will be expected to implement logistic regression, MEMM, etc. She does not teach these algorithms that are necessary to finish your project but happily wastes time talking about IBM Watson, which is just an interesting side thing. In sum, her lectures are not informative; the projects have interesting topics but you have to do a lot of self-studying to do them properly and thus they may end up taking too much time. Deep learning is the future of NLP. You will be better off skipping this class and instead take the free Stanford online course Deep Learning for NLP.",CS 4740,388

TAs had to have emergency office hours at midnight because a ton of students struggled to submit an assignment the night of. Also, the professor had a graduate student lecturing half the time and the quality of those was not as good/hard to follow which was disappointing.

Claire Cardie,2,4,4,"The content of the course can be interesting and helpful if you are genuinely interested in NLP. It is a very project-heavy course where we implement the different models learned in lectures, which takes a lot of time. I had three projects with a partner and the last one alone. No finals or prelims this semester. The lectures are very theoretical, so it can take extra work to translate all the information into code. Prof. Cardie did make it a little interactive by using breakout rooms. We had a few quizzes throughout the semester, which were fine if you go through practice questions. Also had to write a one-page critique paper on different research papers, not too hard, but would have liked more feedback/guidance on that.",CS 4740,388

Lectures are okay (kinda boring, but Claire is clearly very knowledgeable and a sweetheart). But the TAs are entirely responsible for the projects and as a result they are far too underspecified (most people don't even know where to start) and only about 1 TA will understand it well enough to help. For one project, the class was so clueless that they had to hold a 3 hour Saturday lecture (**the day before it was due**) just to explain what the project was asking.",CS 4740,388
Jonathan Park,-,3,-,"Professor Cardie's lectures are extremely dry and boring. The nice part is that she usually brings her dog to do a trick during the beginning of class. The exams are essentially based on memorizing the textbook/class slides.  However, the material itself and projects are interesting. I would still recommend taking the class for the stuff you will learn.",CS 4740,388

Mats Rooth,2,3,3,I took this with Mats Rooths during covid. Every lecture it felt like the professor was winging it as he went. He was always late to class (5-10 mins). Homework felt all over the place. Final project was also sort of ambiguous. No exams just projects. Grading was not too bad though. The class is very disorganized. This class is very linguistics focused too and you use software mostly to do linguistics stuff EX: foma. The hard part is coming up with grammar etc...,CS 4744,389
John Hale,1,4,5,"I took the class with Professor Marten van Schijndel (not the one listed above). More than half the psets (which were actually coding projects except for a few written questions) took more than 20 hours, although the short ones took a range of 1 to 5 hours. There were 7 psets total.  This is a predominantly CS class although it's cross-listed in LING and COGST. The lectures were interesting, but the projects (psets) were extremely frustrating, and the professor and the TA gave out obscure answers when asking for help.  I'm also not sure how much I learned from the projects. I ended up with a good grade, which is based on the projects and some participation, but wouldn't have taken it if I had to choose again.  Definitely know a friend you can discuss with or get to know someone if you take the class.",CS 4744,389
Ross Knepper,3,4,4,"I took this class with Ross Knepper in Fall 2019. This course takes a breadth-over-depth approach, covering many topics instead of focusing on a select few. This proved to be this course's greatest strength as well as its greatest weakness; I learned a little about a lot, but I don't feel like I've learned all that much in one area. I also wish the course talked a bit more about the ECE component of robotics; most of the course focused on MechE topics (kinematics, joints) and statistics (probability, inference, could call this CS). The textbook they provide digitally was confusing to me, but lectures were good. Overall, this was not bad as a survey course, but it certainly missed some points I would have wanted to see.",CS 4750,390
Jaehee Kim,4,2,3,"Taken with Jaehee Kim. She's super nice. This class does not have exams, there's a final project instead. Assignments are coding implementations of algorithms we discuss in class.",CS 4775,391
Amy Williams,5,3,3,"I took this class in Fall 2020 with Professor Williams. I thought the material was really interesting, especially if you're interested in both biology and computer science! There's some algorithms, modeling, probability, and applications to genetics/genomics problems. Professor Williams is really nice and hosts pretty helpful office hours, and I didn't think the workload was terrible? There were problem sets every two weeks or so, as well as a final project of your choice. Readings aren't super necessary but can be helpful, and there were no exams when I took it. Background knowledge of python and maybe some statistics/probability is definitely useful, but I don't think you need too much biology background to succeed in the class!",CS 4775,391
Amy Williams,4,4,4,"I took it with Professor Williams - it's an interesting class, lots of statistics and probability mixed with algorithms and computational models. I think lectures tend to be a bit long and kind of get boring because it's mostly just the material read off of the slides, but I still learnt a lot from the class! There are no exams, only biweekly psets which are around 10-12 hours of work. If you're familiar with Python/coding they shouldn't be too hard, but people without any prior CS experience might spend more time on them. The final project consists of usually just re-implementing a paper, which is quite a lot of work but very rewarding!",CS 4775,391

Wen Sun,5,4,4,"Wen Sun is SUCH AN AMAZING professor, his explanations are always very clear and he clearly has a passion for ML. The theoretical homeworks and coding projects were usually due at the same time so that was a bit intense. But overall I left the class with a very strong understanding and greater interest in ML!",CS 4780,392
Wen Sun,5,2,1,I took it with Wen Sun and the biweekly assignments and projects were pretty easy. I used to get done with all the assignments withing 3-4 hours. There was just one mid term which was kinda hard tho.,CS 4780,392
Christopher De Sa,4,5,3,Great prof! Hard prof! Rubbish course staff. I'd say a total of 5 TAs knew what they were doing. The others were running blind. They often cancelled their office hours whenever a harder homework came out.,CS 4780,392
Christopher De Sa,4,4,4,"Solid course - definitely goes over a lot of core ML topics with an emphasis on the theory and math. De Sa is super knowledgable and a solid lecturer, but he moves pretty fast and it's very easy to fall behind. Projects and homeworks are pretty sizable, and the prelim this semester was very difficult, but also generously curved. Office Hours are definitely helpful, though it's sometimes hard to get good explanations.",CS 4780,392

This is not an easy elective but I recommend it if you want to learn!,CS 4780,392
Christopher De Sa,4,4,4,"The class is very heavy in linear algebra and has some multivariable calculus, so make sure you know your stuff about these subjects. There are some basic stats concepts that you should know as well. There is a prerequisite quiz that you will have to take which will test you on the stuff noted above.  The class has Python programming assignments and written homework assignments as well so expect a decent amount of work. Also, expect to study a decent amount for the midterm and final.",CS 4780,392

Thorsten Joachims,5,4,4,"LOVED this class. Fall 2020 was incredibly well-organized and well-taught. Definitely in my top 3 favorite classes at Cornell. Exams were extremely fair as well. The discussions were a good addition, made the homeworks trivial as the questions were almost the same as discussion. Take this class!",CS 4780,392
Thorsten Joachims,5,3,4,"There was a lot of work (either a coding assignment and normal homeworks every week) but not necessarily too hard, doable if you go to discussion/lecture or watch asynchronously (covid semester). Coding assignments can be frustrating at times trying to get the right ordering of things but once again doable. This class sucks up more time than I thought it would, which is my biggest takeaway. The information is super pertinent and well taught if you're into ML or Data Science and is definitely worth taking.",CS 4780,392
Thorsten Joachims,4,3,5,A cool class! The lectures are very straightforward and easy to follow. I think I learned a lot in this class and all the assignments (coding assignments and psets) were very applicable to class material. Expect a lot of work though.,CS 4780,392
Thorsten Joachims,3,3,2,"PROS: This course's material is legitimately quite interesting, the exams are extremely fair, the homework problems and projects are chosen to force you to learn the material really well, the grading policies are good, and the workload is light. CONS: This course's focus is very theoretical and on pre-deep learning paradigms, so if you want to do modern machine learning, its two lectures on neural nets aren't going to get you very far. Professor Joachims and professor Haghtalab are only okay lecturers, but they focus more on saying things and not putting them on slides, so learning can be very slow if you're not an auditory learner.",CS 4780,392
Thorsten Joachims,5,4,3,"Thorsten and Nika Haghtalab are great professors, though Nika is a better lecturer. She spends more time on examples and on giving the intuition to things, which can be quite confusing because there is a lot of math. In fact, this course is all math (with limited programming projects) and that's not a bug, it's a feature. You should not be applying ML without understanding the theory and being aware of fairness and privacy issues, which Thorsten covered at the end of the class.",CS 4780,392
Thorsten Joachims,5,4,3,"Thorsten and Nika are great professors, though I think Nika is a better teacher because she goes over more details and spends more time on explaining the intuition. Lectures can be quite dense and I've gotten lost/had to rewatch multiple lectures because the course tries to pack a lot of material into 1 semester. Agree with other reviewers that this class won't teach you practical application of ML, but that's not a bug, it's a feature. You should not try applying ML without understanding the theory and issues of fairness and privacy.",CS 4780,392
Thorsten Joachims,3,3,2,"You will not come out of this class as a machine learning expert. Content is interesting, but the programming assignments are small, isolated, and do not give you good real world experience. Lectures with Thorsten are hard to follow. Nika's were really good.

Although Chris De Sa tries really hard, he isn't a good lecturer. His explanations jump all over the place and a lot people are confused afterwards. If you memorize the lecture notes for the exams, you should be good. Don't procrastinate on the pre-exam (which isn't bad if you take the time to do it). The projects just are a verbatim of the lecture notes in code format, but they do take time. The final (optional) project is cool because you have to do everything by scratch.

PCA, kernels), but did poorly at explaining the math behind them.",CS 4786,393

This class covers some very applicable modern ML concepts, so it's a nice progression from a class like 4780 that covers the foundations. However, the class was pretty badly organized in terms of logistics - office hours were super unhelpful because it was clear that the TAs had not been given the solution sets to the psets or the programming assignments, and were winging it. Grading was a little arbitrary (and also very late!). We had 6 problem sets and 6 programming assignments, and by the final only 2 of each had been graded.

If you put in the effort into the problem sets and go over the solutions when they come out then usually you'll do fine on the prelims as they are designed for the people who actually understood the problem sets.

Also there was little opportunity for feedback, since there aren't enough TAs to leave detailed grading comments or discuss our work one-on-one.

Adrian Sampson,5,4,3,"Sampson is an amazing lecturer -- great at explaining the material in a captivating manner and has an amazing ability to answer questions in a clear and concise manner. The course focuses on formalizations of programming languages and type systems, which contains lots of discrete mathematics. The assignments are challenging and push you but are satisfying once completed. Assignments and prelims are hard because they push you to do things you haven't done in class and because the formal nature of things forces you to be 100% to get correct. Would highly recommend if you would like to take a very interesting course that deepens your CS knowledge in profound ways, especially if you liked 2800 and 3110.",CS 5110,404
John Foster,4,3,4,"Took it under Nate Foster. It was a pretty interesting class. You learn about the foundations of programming languages, and after taking the course, you will be at least moderately confident in building your own programming language. Homeworks can get very theoretical, but there's the occasional coding assignment thrown in (we use OCaml). The class has an open ended final project. Problem sets can get tricky for some topics but mostly manageable.",CS 5110,404

John Foster,4,4,3,"The professor is Nate Foster (not John as the tag states below), and he was very engaging to the class during his lectures. The course material is very interesting, if you're interested in the theory and logic behind programming languages. Lectures are a little fast, so it is good that notes are released beforehand and lectures are recorded. The homework is a bit challenging but not too long or frequent. The exams are challenging (probably a step up from the homework) but interesting. The final project allows you to apply what you've learned in class and go above and beyond This class isn't for everybody but for people interested in PL and/or enjoy making inductive proofs, I highly recommend!",CS 5110,404

Andrew Myers,5,5,5,"Myers is an amazing lecturer -- probably the best lecturer I've ever had. He explains the material in depth, is clear and concise, and is clearly well organized and practiced. I found the content in this course to be the most interesting compared to any other CS topic I've come across. That being said, in order to get the most out of (and pass) this course, you must put in high effort and lots of time. The prelims cover lots of information because the lectures are high paced and Myers goes in depth about the material. The project is incredibly fun, especially with partners who are also hard working. Building the compiler took around 20+ hours per week per person which is a significant commitment in addition to homeworks and lectures. However this project causes you to grow in ways that nothing else at Cornell even comes close to. This class inspired me to become a Compiler Engineer after graduating (having built a compiler was a massive reason I got the job!). I would recommend this class to everyone -- the high commitment is easily worth what you will get out of this class. There is no class at Cornell that compares to this Course (in my opinion",CS 5120,406

Andrew Myers,4,5,5,"Professor Myers is great! He is a very engaging lecturer, and his course notes are very clear. Overall the class is very intense, but it is a very rewarding experience to get through. I think it's very important to go in with a team you know and have worked with before, just because each assignment is so intense. The TAs are all really knowledgeable and are very helpful - go to office hours a lot! I would highly recommend this class as a practicum.",CS 5120,406
Andrew Myers,5,5,5,"Professor Myers is really great, and the course is an incredible learning experience. Lectures are very thorough, sometimes fast-paced.

Pacing is also somewhat odd - fast at times, slower at others - but is generally followable. The content of the course itself is somewhat useful , but I was disappointed to find out there is no coding in this class (unless you count SQL queries as ""coding""). The benefit of this is the vastly-reduced amount of work you have to do; when I took it, the only assignments that counted for a grade were 5 problem sets (really 4, your worst one is dropped), 1 prelim, and 1 final exam. It's overall an OK course - I just wish it could be taught in a more engaging manner than it currently is.",CS 5320,413
Immanuel Trummer,-,3,-,Taking this class with Trummer is extremely boring but the course material is useful for interviews and actually interesting if you can teach it to yourself.

Fred Schneider,4,2,2,"Professor Schneider is incredibly knowledgeable and experienced, and it clearly shows in class. Lectures are well organized and connected, if a little long. The organization of the course is a slight drawback because there is no Ed and communication occurs entirely in class and through an ""announcements"" section on the course website. The content is highly theoretical, so this is not a pentesting or learning to construct attacks, but more about learning security principles, protocols, and concepts. The first half of the class, the workload was 4 worksheets graded for completion, and the second half was a programming project that was slightly more involved, partially because it was specified at a very high level and assumes quite a bit of programming experience. The midterm was relatively challenging, but the final was optional if you completed all other parts of the course. ",CS 5430,417

It's a lot of fun to feel like you're learning about the process of creating something you can see visually, and taken with the prac, it was very fun and rewarding to projects you can see and interact with. They are right when they say that the ""cool factor"" of this class is very high. I personally found the class extremely interesting, and am so glad I took it.

Prof. Marschner is the same as he always is (incredibly friendly, but a bit dry during lectures), but the projects are vastly more interesting and hands-on than you see in 4620. As a result, you end up learning a lot more about the actual graphics pipeline. It's also a lot more practical, as you spend a lot more time writing real shaders instead of having them be relegated to a single, hand-holdy exercise.

Marschner is an extremely nice professor, and is constantly updating the course to ensure you get to learn about modern graphics techniques (like real time ray tracing) while also covering (relevant) traditional methods. Whereas 4620 seems more like an overview of various graphics topics, this class really lets you delve into cool projects rendering things like shadows, bloom lighting, and so much more that looks so realistic.

Claire Cardie,1,4,4,"This class is highly disorganized, and it doesn't seem like the professor has a major hand on the course logistics. The projects are difficult not because of the content but because of the ambiguity in the description and the grading schema. The lectures are based off the textbook and are somehow made more confusing. You're better off reading the textbook than going to lecture. The grades and projects are never released on time, yet they still expect the students to somehow meet the deadline.",CS 5740,421
Claire Cardie,2,5,5,"I came into the class with high expectations for NLP but this class really disappointed me by the way it's taught and kind of killed some of my interest of the subject. The lectures didn't prepare me for the projects at all. We went through algorithms in class but nothing about the implementation conventions. If you are not familiar with PyTorch and all those NLP packages, it will be a huge pain to search the documentation and often I didn't even know where to start because no one tells me what to look at. Thus, the projects are super time-consuming. I spent much more time on this class than on 3410 which is known for its heavy workload. Also, idk if it's bc the class is in the morning, the lecture is super dry and dead, the professor and the PhD lecturer really lack some enthusiasm in teaching and thus made the material much less engaging than it should have been.",CS 5740,421

Claire Cardie,1,4,5,"I took this class because I want to learn about NLP, but was thoroughly disappointed on the course structure, or more accurately speaking, the lack of structure. CS 4740 was one of the classes that fit my schedule for Fall 2020 where I took this class online. Lectures were decent, but could be better, there was a technical microphone issue where the professor's audio was practically inaudible and students were not able to hear clearly. Project guidelines were long, open-ended, overly wordy, and required students to write tedious code that were not directly related to class material.",CS 5740,421
Claire Cardie,-,3,-,"I really regret taking this class over my other options. Prof. Cardie's lectures are almost entirely based on Jurafsky's textbook. The examples and figures in her slides are straight from that textbook, and thus you can skip most of the lectures if you just do the reading. Honestly, I think reading the textbook is the more efficient way to learn the materials since her lectures are poorly organized. She spends a lot of time explaining linguistics concepts but not enough time on math and algorithms. This is very troublesome if you have a big project team (3-4 people), because you will be expected to implement logistic regression, MEMM, etc. She does not teach these algorithms that are necessary to finish your project but happily wastes time talking about IBM Watson, which is just an interesting side thing. In sum, her lectures are not informative; the projects have interesting topics but you have to do a lot of self-studying to do them properly and thus they may end up taking too much time. Deep learning is the future of NLP. You will be better off skipping this class and instead take the free Stanford online course Deep Learning for NLP.",CS 5740,421
Lillian Lee,2,4,5,"I regret taking this class. Workload insane. Unorganized. As much as I still love both prof Lillian and Marten and the context, this class was a disaster. I put in so much effort and still ended up with my worst grade of the semester.",CS 5740,421
Lillian Lee,2,4,4,"Took it with Lillian and Marty. Lillian didn't lecture, only Marty did and he wasn't the best. The organization of the course definitely needs improvement. Throughout assignments, the profs would constantly update the requirements and instructions, even just a few days before the due date.",CS 5740,421
Claire Cardie,1,3,5,"Awful lecture, and heavy project.",CS 5740,421
Claire Cardie,3,3,3,"Professor Cardie got rid of exams for COVID-19. Overall the class was interesting but very disorganized- the projects are super vague and take up a lot of time just figuring out what to do. TAs had to have emergency office hours at midnight because a ton of students struggled to submit an assignment the night of. Also, the professor had a graduate student lecturing half the time and the quality of those was not as good/hard to follow which was disappointing. The structure of the class didn't make sense as a hybrid (like breakout rooms when half the students are in-person and half online).",CS 5740,421
Claire Cardie,2,4,4,"The content of the course can be interesting and helpful if you are genuinely interested in NLP. It is a very project-heavy course where we implement the different models learned in lectures, which takes a lot of time. I had three projects with a partner and the last one alone. No finals or prelims this semester. The lectures are very theoretical, so it can take extra work to translate all the information into code. Prof. Cardie did make it a little interactive by using breakout rooms. We had a few quizzes throughout the semester, which were fine if you go through practice questions. Also had to write a one-page critique paper on different research papers, not too hard, but would have liked more feedback/guidance on that.",CS 5740,421
Jonathan Park,-,4,-,"THE single most disorganized class I have ever taken. I was really excited about the subject material, but this class was very poorly executed. Lectures are okay (kinda boring, but Claire is clearly very knowledgeable and a sweetheart). But the TAs are entirely responsible for the projects and as a result they are far too underspecified (most people don't even know where to start) and only about 1 TA will understand it well enough to help. For one project, the class was so clueless that they had to hold a 3 hour Saturday lecture (**the day before it was due**) just to explain what the project was asking.",CS 5740,421
Jonathan Park,-,3,-,"Professor Cardie's lectures are extremely dry and boring. The nice part is that she usually brings her dog to do a trick during the beginning of class. The exams are essentially based on memorizing the textbook/class slides.  However, the material itself and projects are interesting. I would still recommend taking the class for the stuff you will learn.",CS 5740,421

Ross Knepper,3,4,4,"I took this class with Ross Knepper in Fall 2019. This course takes a breadth-over-depth approach, covering many topics instead of focusing on a select few. This proved to be this course's greatest strength as well as its greatest weakness; I learned a little about a lot, but I don't feel like I've learned all that much in one area. I also wish the course talked a bit more about the ECE component of robotics; most of the course focused on MechE topics (kinematics, joints) and statistics (probability, inference, could call this CS). The textbook they provide digitally was confusing to me, but lectures were good. Overall, this was not bad as a survey course, but it certainly missed some points I would have wanted to see.",CS 5750,422
Thorsten Joachims,3,4,3,"Not always a whole lot of work, but when there is, it's pretty hard. Also very hard to understand the material in lecture.",CS 5780,423
Wen Sun,5,4,4,"Wen Sun is SUCH AN AMAZING professor, his explanations are always very clear and he clearly has a passion for ML. The theoretical homeworks and coding projects were usually due at the same time so that was a bit intense. But overall I left the class with a very strong understanding and greater interest in ML!",CS 5780,423
Wen Sun,5,2,1,I took it with Wen Sun and the biweekly assignments and projects were pretty easy. I used to get done with all the assignments withing 3-4 hours. There was just one mid term which was kinda hard tho.,CS 5780,423
Christopher De Sa,4,5,3,Great prof! Hard prof! Rubbish course staff. I'd say a total of 5 TAs knew what they were doing. The others were running blind. They often cancelled their office hours whenever a harder homework came out.,CS 5780,423
Christopher De Sa,4,4,4,"Solid course - definitely goes over a lot of core ML topics with an emphasis on the theory and math. De Sa is super knowledgable and a solid lecturer, but he moves pretty fast and it's very easy to fall behind. Projects and homeworks are pretty sizable, and the prelim this semester was very difficult, but also generously curved. Office Hours are definitely helpful, though it's sometimes hard to get good explanations.",CS 5780,423
Christopher De Sa,5,4,4,I took this class in SP 22 with Christopher De Sa. He is an awesome lecturer and always so passionate during lectures. Contents are a bit challenging but they are  really useful and interesting. Problem sets and programming assignments were not easy but definitely doable. This is not an easy elective but I recommend it if you want to learn!,CS 5780,423
Christopher De Sa,4,4,4,"The class is very heavy in linear algebra and has some multivariable calculus, so make sure you know your stuff about these subjects. There are some basic stats concepts that you should know as well. There is a prerequisite quiz that you will have to take which will test you on the stuff noted above.  The class has Python programming assignments and written homework assignments as well so expect a decent amount of work. Also, expect to study a decent amount for the midterm and final.",CS 5780,423

Thorsten Joachims,3,4,3,"Generally, a fair amount of work and the TAs are very helpful. Sometimes programming assignments and problem sets would align with the prelim and professors were not too understanding about the workload that was being put onto students. Overall if you do your work and pay attention to the lecture videos, you can do just fine.",CS 5780,423
Thorsten Joachims,5,4,4,"LOVED this class. Fall 2020 was incredibly well-organized and well-taught. Definitely in my top 3 favorite classes at Cornell. Exams were extremely fair as well. The discussions were a good addition, made the homeworks trivial as the questions were almost the same as discussion. Take this class!",CS 5780,423
Thorsten Joachims,5,3,4,"There was a lot of work (either a coding assignment and normal homeworks every week) but not necessarily too hard, doable if you go to discussion/lecture or watch asynchronously (covid semester). Coding assignments can be frustrating at times trying to get the right ordering of things but once again doable. This class sucks up more time than I thought it would, which is my biggest takeaway. The information is super pertinent and well taught if you're into ML or Data Science and is definitely worth taking.",CS 5780,423
Thorsten Joachims,4,3,5,A cool class! The lectures are very straightforward and easy to follow. I think I learned a lot in this class and all the assignments (coding assignments and psets) were very applicable to class material. Expect a lot of work though.,CS 5780,423
Thorsten Joachims,3,3,2,"PROS: This course's material is legitimately quite interesting, the exams are extremely fair, the homework problems and projects are chosen to force you to learn the material really well, the grading policies are good, and the workload is light. CONS: This course's focus is very theoretical and on pre-deep learning paradigms, so if you want to do modern machine learning, its two lectures on neural nets aren't going to get you very far. Professor Joachims and professor Haghtalab are only okay lecturers, but they focus more on saying things and not putting them on slides, so learning can be very slow if you're not an auditory learner.",CS 5780,423
Thorsten Joachims,5,4,3,"Thorsten and Nika Haghtalab are great professors, though Nika is a better lecturer. She spends more time on examples and on giving the intuition to things, which can be quite confusing because there is a lot of math. In fact, this course is all math (with limited programming projects) and that's not a bug, it's a feature. You should not be applying ML without understanding the theory and being aware of fairness and privacy issues, which Thorsten covered at the end of the class.",CS 5780,423
Thorsten Joachims,5,4,3,"Thorsten and Nika are great professors, though I think Nika is a better teacher because she goes over more details and spends more time on explaining the intuition. Lectures can be quite dense and I've gotten lost/had to rewatch multiple lectures because the course tries to pack a lot of material into 1 semester. Agree with other reviewers that this class won't teach you practical application of ML, but that's not a bug, it's a feature. You should not try applying ML without understanding the theory and issues of fairness and privacy.",CS 5780,423
Thorsten Joachims,3,3,2,"You will not come out of this class as a machine learning expert. Content is interesting, but the programming assignments are small, isolated, and do not give you good real world experience. Lectures with Thorsten are hard to follow. Nika's were really good. Sometimes you feel a little bogged down in notation, theory, proofs, when all you really want are the applications. Nevertheless, would recommend taking this class for CS majors. Problem sets and assignments were less frequent than once a week, and only 1 prelim.",CS 5780,423

The psets are usually 3 problems with a few subparts. The projects are longer but go much deeper in the material by making you implement real ML algorithms. The exams are significantly easier than the homework,.",CS 5780,423

Kilian Weinberger,-,3,-,"Killian Weinberger &amp; Chris De Sa (Spring 2018). My favorite class at Cornell! Killian's a great lecturer and makes ML super interesting, especially at 8:40 am. Although Chris De Sa tries really hard, he isn't a good lecturer. His explanations jump all over the place and a lot people are confused afterwards. If you memorize the lecture notes for the exams, you should be good. Don't procrastinate on the pre-exam (which isn't bad if you take the time to do it). The projects just are a verbatim of the lecture notes in code format, but they do take time. The final (optional) project is cool because you have to do everything by scratch. Overall, it's a great course - super interesting &amp; exciting.",CS 5780,423
Kilian Weinberger,-,3,-,"Kilian Weinberger is a fantastic lecturer and stimulates your interest in the subject very well.

PCA, kernels), but did poorly at explaining the math behind them.",CS 5786,424

But sometimes instructions were not given clearly.",DEA 6700,442
Larry Brown,1,4,5,"I'm going to go ahead and contradict the popular opinions about this class. It's not a good choice for an easy A. It's not ""hard"" in the grand scheme of things, but it's just *so much* work. All you do is memorize facts. All the exams are regurgitating those facts. Every week, the homework is at least 100 multiple choice questions. If memorization is not your thing, beware. I'm sure that people who either are good at memorization or fine with really grinding to retain content thrive in this class, but it consistently beat me down. The content wasn't necessarily boring, but it wasn't interesting enough to be 4-4.5 hours of my week all in. Mostly, I just found it to be a letdown given all of the hype.",EAS 1220,443

David Albonesi,4,2,2,I enjoyed this course - Albonesi is a nice and approachable professor. The course was flipped where we would watch lectures by ourselves before coming to class and in class discuss and do worksheets in groups. I found those worksheets very helpful in understanding the course content. This course also prepared me for CS 2300 and gave me a good base.,ECE 1210,454
David Albonesi,4,2,1,"This was an enjoyable class that starts from the basics of a computer and works its way towards more complexity. The workload is pretty light even with the flipped classroom, as homework problems are multiple choice and fairly easy. In class, Albonesi goes over the concepts from the videos watched the night before. The content of prelims are as expected. Overall, a good and informative class.",ECE 1210,454
David Albonesi,3,3,3,"The class is basically an edx course, the videos aren't very interesting and the class got bad after the first prelim. His lecture is just pointing at a presentation and underlining things that he went over in the videos. Unless  you really like ece it can be really boring.",ECE 1210,454
David Albonesi,5,3,3,"The videos from the flipped classrooms were very well organized and easy to follow. Also, Albonesei covers the topics again in the lectures and clears any confusing points as well as goes over problem sets which are helpful. There are assignments (Check Your Understanding, Labs, HW) all on edX and they are manageable. For CYU and HW, you get two attempts so they are fairly doable.",ECE 1210,454
David Albonesi,4,2,2,"The workload isn't bad at all. It's a flipped classroom so you watch videos and answer a few questions before going to 'lecture' where he goes over some concepts and you just do practice problems in a breakout room. Overall, Albonesi is a pretty good lecturer and the videos are clear for the most part. Lecture material is interesting as well.",ECE 1210,454
David Albonesi,5,2,2,"This was a very straightforward class that was not very difficult. As long as you pay attention in lecture and do the practice that he gives you, you will get a good grade. Albonesi is an excellent lecturer and explains concepts really well. This class was a good introduction to both ECE and CS, and a lot of the material overlaps with ECE 2300. Although the material in 2300 goes somewhat deeper, a lot of the basic topics covered are the same. I took this class and ECE 2300 together, and found that it helped solidify my understanding of the material in both classes.",ECE 1210,454
David Albonesi,4,3,3,"The difficulty of the course comes from the fact that the majority of the material isn't something students have generally seen before. Very much a flipped classroom -- there are multiple videos to watch before each lecture. Every exam was fair, and the class was not curved at the end.",ECE 1210,454
David Albonesi,3,3,3,I like the flipped classroom idea where you watch the lecture slides and do problems in class.  This class is a good introduction to CS 3410 so it helped me have somewhat of an idea of what was happening when I took that.,ECE 1210,454
David Albonesi,-,2,-,"The classroom is flipped, so there were online videos you had to watch and review questions to do. ""Labs"" were also online, which basically required dragging components around and wiring them together. Showing up to lecture was not mandatory, but I found that Albonesi and the review questions was pretty helpful. If you end up taking ECE 2300, it's mostly the same material.",ECE 1210,454
Alyosha Christopher Molnar,-,4,-,"Took the class with Molnar in Fall 2017, and agree strongly with the previous review. He is a brilliant professor, and very approachable. The class is a lot of work, but it is by no means busy work - the problems and labs are challenging, but interesting! Learned a lot.",ECE 2100,455
Clifford Pollock,3,5,3,"Pollock is really nice and sometimes lenient abt due dates if you ask him,  but the actual material for this class is VERY difficult and can be hard to understand even if you go to lectures and read the textbook.",ECE 2100,455

David Albonesi,5,3,3,"David is a very kind professor. Goes kind of fast, but the concepts are easy and manageable.",ECE 2300,456
Zhiru Zhang,5,3,4,"Zhiru Zhang is a very good professor. He makes very good videos that if you missed lectures, you can still learn the materials based of his videos. Overall, despite the decent workload he gives you, its worth taking this class ",ECE 2300,456
Zhiru Zhang,5,3,4,"Great professor. Class was somewhat challenging but extremely rewarding and very logic based. The only thing was that labs do take time, especially towards the end of the year.",ECE 2300,456
Zhiru Zhang,4,3,3,I enjoyed the class. Zhang is a pretty solid and well-organized lecturer. The labs were manageable as long as you are time efficient. There were plenty of office hours so it was very easy to get help!,ECE 2300,456
Edward Suh,4,3,3,"Pretty solid class with material really well explained in the lectures. A lot of ways to practice for tests. The labs are kinda long and sometimes annoying, but it is definitely an class to take that is not too hard.",ECE 2300,456
Zhiru Zhang,3,3,4,"Much harder than the class was with Albonesi, according to friends. Zhang is a great lecturer, but having three assignments a week at times, averaging to 2 assignments due every week (lab+pset) was really a lot.",ECE 2300,456
Edward Suh,4,3,4,"Took during S20 with Edward Suh. He explains the topics well but lectures may be dry with later concepts. Homeworks are not that hard to do with lecture material, and labs might take a long time, and verilog is just bad. Exams are very fair and reviewing homework and past prelims is very helpful. Good introduction to ECE if you have never taken something similar. Do not take this class after Wines or you will fall asleep every time.",ECE 2300,456
David Albonesi,3,3,3,"The class is not hard, but it's definitely not easy either. Professor Albonesi goes through the lecture material pretty fast, but you can easily review the stuff afterward. The weekly homework can have mildly challenging problems and the labs in the second half of the semester can take a long time to debug. However, going to office hours for labs helps a lot, but you would need to start the labs early, or else the office hours are usually very crowded. The random partners for labs can be very annoying if you don't get paired with someone good. But exams are easy if you just do the practice ones they give you.",ECE 2300,456
David Albonesi,5,3,2,"I took it with Professor Albonesi. Lectures are a bit long, but he's really good at answering questions. Also is very understanding about Covid and spread out assignments after students have suggested it on Piazza. I think labs can be tough, but TAs are pretty helpful at debugging (which takes the longest).",ECE 2300,456
David Albonesi,5,3,4,"Albonesi is an awesome professor whose lectures are pretty thorough, and he's always opening to answering lots of questions and clarifying topics during lecture. The way he and the course staff handled course organization and logistics during COVID-19 was pretty considerate and caring towards students (open note for two prelims and a final, lots of practice prelims). There's a good amount of work (weekly psets and labs) but nothing that I ever felt was busy work or unnecessary.  Overall, a good class!",ECE 2300,456
David Albonesi,3,3,3,"I am currently taking this class and if you are a CS major like me who is trying to just get a requirement out of the way, it can be hard to enjoy this class. It's definitely out of scope and I'm still learning to appreciate the material. The lecture slides are really comprehensive but his lectures are a bit monotonous. Labs are worth 30% of our grade which is greater than our prelims which are 20% each. But they TAKE FOREVER. There have been weeks were we had something due 4 different days of the week which is kind of absurd. However, he is super understanding and after some complaints, he spread the assignments out more. The prelims are also very similar to the practice he gives you and are pretty fair but they don't give great partial credit. I'm taking it fall 2020 and the exams were in person open note which really REALLY helps. I would suspect that without notes this class would be mostly memorization. Overall the class is okay and the prof is pretty cool!",ECE 2300,456
David Albonesi,4,3,3,The prof goes through lectures extremely fast and it was hard to keep up with the material. The good thing about online classes is that I can always watch the recordings later. The worst thing is that we don't get to choose our own lab groups. My first partner always pushes off the meeting time we had previously settled on. My second partner either doesn't do what he promised to do what does them the very last minute. I ended up doing most of the labs by myself.,ECE 2300,456
Edward Suh,2,5,3,Test questions did not reflect the difficulty of HWs and lectures are incomprehensible if you do not do the corresponding readings.,ECE 2300,456
Edward Suh,2,4,4,"Took this with Edward Suh Spring 20. Without considering the whole covid situation, I personally didn't really like the class. The content was alright, but Prof Suh didn't really organize the class very well in my opinion. Some TAs were great (mostly the undergraduate ones), but I didn't find the graduate TAs helpful. Labs were long, but understandably so (but don't take it from me, I only had 2 labs that were in person). The first prelim was really easy, but the take home ones afterwards (covid) were really really hard.",ECE 2300,456
David Albonesi,5,2,4,"Took it with Albonesi Fall 20. The class had lectures that explained the processor really well. The lab, especially the last 2, were long.",ECE 2300,456
Edward Suh,-,4,-,"Pretty difficult for CS majors and requires a good amount of memorization for the exams. Labs can be difficult if you're stuck with a bad partner, and office hours lines can get pretty long.",ECE 2300,456
Edward Suh,-,3,-,"Test questions are formed from lectures slides, so make sure to look at the smallest of questions on the slides because they usually end up being on prelims. Homework questions work the same way. I found homework to be way way easier when I was ahead in the class material. Labs suck a lot if you have a bad, unwilling group. Ended up doing most of them on my  own and not going to lab sections.",ECE 2300,456
David Albonesi,-,2,-,"Took in fall 2017 with David Albonesi. The content is not difficult at all, but Albonesi has a soothing voice and it's easy to fall asleep in class sometimes. Lecture slides are good quality and quite easy to understand. Homeworks aren't particularly difficult, but labs can be quite time consuming. The assigned textbook is generally great supplementary material. Exams are crammable as well.",ECE 2300,456
Jose Martinez,-,4,-,"I took the course with Christopher Batten in Fall 2018. He was a great professor. He was always prepared and super enthusiastic about teaching. He goes over so many examples and really makes sure students understand the concepts. He allows for asking lots of questions. I took this course after taking the Python course. In this course you start with learning C in the first half, then you transition to C++. In this class, I felt like I like I learned so much. I learned about multi-paradigm programming - procedural, objected oriented, generic, functional and a little bit of concurrent programming. You also learn about static and dynamic polymorphism. Highly recommend this course with Christopher Batten.",ECE 2400,457
Jose Martinez,-,5,-,"Fall 2018: Definitely a rough one. Probably one of the best classes to take if you're ECE and want to learn software (for both software engineering jobs or even just as an ECE out and about in the field you should definitely know C and C++), or even a CS major who wants to learn C and C++. Batten is an amazing lecturer but he is also detailed orriented so you gotta make sure you check everything and really solidify your understanding of the material. You definitely come out a much better programmer, very confident in my abilities now.         BUT you go through war to get there. Just be prepared to grind through the reports at the end of each programming assignments. Exams are tough, but also if I showed up to class on time maybe they'd be aiight. If punctuality isn't your thing this class probably isn't for you.",ECE 2400,457
Christopher Batten,2,2,5,I took this course with professor Christopher Fall 2020. I'd say the professor is pretty nice so I'd prefer rate the course a 2 instead of 1. The he assignments took me at least 20 hours per week. I'd recommend take CS2110 and learn cpp yourself.,ECE 2400,457
Christopher Batten,5,3,4,"Professor Batten is an amazing lecturer are really cares about making sure his student's understand programming. I would definitely recommend any ECE student to take 2400 over 2110 just for the shear quality of the class, even if it will be a bit more work due to the reports.",ECE 2400,457
Christopher Batten,4,3,5,The class is taught well but the workload is excessive.,ECE 2400,457
Jose Martinez,-,3,-,Great class! Was a nice review of programming concepts after taking 2110. Plus you get to learn both C and C++. Martinez knows his stuff and teaches you well.,ECE 2400,457
Aaron Wagner,4,4,3,"Class was great lecture-wise; really enjoyed Wagner's teaching style, course material, and office hour policies. Homeworks aren't too bad for the most part but if you go to office hours he just gives the answers. The tests I felt were significantly more difficult than any of the homeworks and with the class being relatively new there are no previous tests to practice off of which made it miserable to go through but the curve helps take care of that.",ECE 2720,458
Farhan Rana,5,3,3,"Took with Prof. Monticone (this website won't let me add another professor to the drop down menu containing the professor options smh), who is very charismatic and just a nice guy. Great class, used Rana's notes but taught it at a more reasonable pace and approachable manner. Weekly problem sets but nothing extreme, and Monticone is very helpful during office hours. Tests were about the same difficulty as homeworks. If you are into the physics side of ECE or want to learn about antennas and the ""physical"" aspect of signal processing/communications, this is the class to take, as there are no other antenna theory classes in ECE, which is quite sad.",ECE 3030,459
Qing Zhao,4,4,4,"Like the other reviews said, the class is not bad in the beginning, but towards the final we learned too much too quickly and it was overwhelming. I really enjoyed Professor Zhao's lectures though; they are very clear and logical and she does not assume you know things or rush through topics too quickly.",ECE 3100,460
David Delchamps,5,3,3,Delchamps was a great professor for this class. It was obvious he really cared about people learning and the students. His handwriting was difficult to read at times so I would recommend going to lecture in person if possible. The homeworks and exams were really far with material covered and difficult. The material was also really fun in general. One of the best engineering classes I have had.,ECE 3100,460
A. Kevin Tang,4,4,4,"This class was very straightforward in the beginning if you've taken AP Statistics. However, the material becomes progressively more challenging as the semester goes on, and the homeworks become more difficult. The exams and homeworks test not just memorizing equations, but more of how to apply them to new situations. I highly recommend going to office hours for this class, as the TAs can help clear up any confusion you have about what exactly to use to do any of the homework problems. Otherwise, it may take you hours to figure out how to solve a given problem. Also, start early on the homework, so you can get help when you get stuck.",ECE 3100,460
David Delchamps,4,3,3,"Make every effort possible to take classes with Delchamps, including this one. Lectures were detailed, but easy to follow. Delchamps is very conversational and you feel that he is on your side and wants to help. Problem sets were weekly, but not too long, and were all the preparation you need for a test. Delchamps made sure to add in applications of the theory we were learning, which was nice. Very few proofs. Recitations are completely optional and not necessary to succeed.",ECE 3100,460
Nils Napp,1,3,3,"Worst class I have ever taken at Cornell. Prof Napp's lectures are downright terrible and he winds through examples for the whole lecture but does not tell us the main point (?), so it is too hard to understand. Required lectures to watch and no prelims, only labs and quizzes. Asked mom if we could have ECE 3140 with Martinez and she said no we have ECE 3140 at home. ECE 3140 at home: Nils Napp.",ECE 3140,461
Nils Napp,1,1,2,"Definitely the worst class I've had at Cornell, though Nils Napp was overwhelmingly the contributing factor. Class material was pretty straightforward with CS background, but labs and assignments are nearly impossible to debug and have been developed so testing and checking your work is difficult or impossible. Assignment design is terrible. There were no exams! A partner for most of the semester was assigned randomly, which always goes super well (lol). The ECE majors in the class seemed less prepared because some of them didn't even know Java before being thrown into C.",ECE 3140,461
Nils Napp,3,3,4,I took this class SP 22 with Prof Napp. The course structure was basically flipped classroom where we were expected to watch lecture recordings and complete weekly quizzes. The labs &amp; project take up 60% and they are not easy but doable. Since there were no exams it was nice.,ECE 3140,461
Nils Napp,3,3,3,"Class has been alright. Was taught asynchronous, and the lectures were decent, with weekly quizzes which were not very challenging. No exams, just labs, but the labs are confusing and hard.",ECE 3140,461
Nils Napp,3,3,3,Professor Napp had prepared online videos and classes were done in a reverse classroom style. He responded relatively well to feedback from students but the material itself was hard to learn and connect directly to the labs.,ECE 3140,461
Nils Napp,3,1,1,"Our semester was completely asynchronous, with weekly lecture quizzes for pre-recorded lectures. We also had no tests and only labs, which made this class almost no stress for this year. I can't say about other years in the future though.",ECE 3140,461

Nils Napp,1,1,1,"This is by far the worst class I've taken at Cornell. Although this class was the most free and easiest class I've ever taken,  the lectures were quite terrible and the final project was poorly organized. I napped every time Prof Napp started to lecture and got my video watching participation just like that.",ECE 3140,461
Nils Napp,2,3,3,"Not a great class. The professor is very new and seems disorganized. Grades consist of quizzes and labs, and lectures are a little hard to follow. Lab partners were assigned for everyone and kept for the whole semester, so if you had a bad partner you were stuck with them for almost all the labs.",ECE 3140,461
Nils Napp,5,3,3,"I really enjoy 3140 with Professor Napp. It doesn't deserve all the hate that it gets. The quizzes are really straight forward and based on the slides, and the labs (while slightly difficult) are very insightful and there are plenty of office hours to get your code looked over and fixed. Most of the complaining I hear is from long office hour lines for the day before and day that the labs are due, since everyone leaves it for last minute.",ECE 3140,461
Jose Martinez,2,4,3,"I did not like this class. Martinez taught lecture ok enough, but the prelims were really unfair. He did not even give our prelims back. You had to go to office hours to see them. I think he just reuses the same prelims. The labs were fine. A little difficult, but nothing outside of lab work for similar classes.",ECE 3140,461
Edward Suh,5,3,4,"Took this class with Professor Nils Napp. The most challenging part was definitely the labs. Exams and homeworks were pretty straightforward, and the homeworks were not too time consuming. For the labs, make sure to get started early, as debugging takes a lot of time. Also, try to find a good partner that you work well with, as that really helps. Go to office hours to help debugging get done quicker. This is a very useful class in embedded systems, and the knowledge will really help if you go into embedded programming in industry.",ECE 3140,461

James Shealy,3,5,5,"This course is one of the most difficult classes I've taken at Cornell (and I've taken plenty of upper level ECE and CS classes). I feel that the lectures were not very useful because they're reiterating material on the lecture notes. However, the lecture notes are incredibly well written and very helpful to gaining an understanding for this subject. The subject is incredibly complex, involves a lot of advanced physics and maths, and covers a lot of material which makes the class seem rather fast paced. The labs involve a lot of work, not so much lab time, but rather a lot of time needs to be spent analyzing lab results and constructing graphs using Matlab (or Python if you prefer). The homework questions are mostly very difficult and there tend to be a lot of them in a single homework. The great part about this class is that Prof Shealy is available in the mornings everyday at his office to help resolve any questions about the material, the homeworks or the labs. He also set a really easy final which helped to easy our stress. It turns out that this class is not very useful if you're going into digital logic or CS. However, if you're going into analog circuit design,",ECE 3150,462
James Shealy,4,5,5,"This class was the most challenging class that I have taken in ECE and at Cornell. It is also the most time consuming class that I have taken, as labs and homeworks take over ten hours to do. The midterm was also challenging, and really tests your knowledge on the low level function of semiconductors. Some people say that this class is the second part of ECE 2100, but that is not really the case. It does require basic circuit knowledge from 2100, but it really builds upon that with lots of semiconductor physics and many equations. Be prepared to work hard in this class, but it is definitely rewarding to understand basic electronic components on a deeper level, and is useful for many later analog and digital classes.",ECE 3150,462
James Shealy,4,5,4,"6 labs, 5 homeworks. No lie, it's hella hard. But very rewarding, kind of? If you put in the effort to conceptually understand the topics, you can definitely beat the curve on the midterm. Very worth if you're interested in anything analog or vaguely digital that uses transistors.",ECE 3150,462
Carl Poitras,1,3,4,"The class is very disorganized, and you didn't really learn anything in lecture. The professor often cancel classes also. Lab documentations are poorly written and hard to follow. Parts in the lab are of poor quality and tend to break easily. Because of that, one usually spend unnecessarily long time in lab trying to debug the robots. It is required for ECE, but definitely not a good class. :(",ECE 3400,463
David Forbes Delchamps,-,2,-,"SP18. Delchamps is a great guy and a good lecturer but the way he ran the class made little sense. It was significantly easier than similar classes like 3100 (midterm had mean 87, final was likely similar) and he didn't go very deep into any topics but median was still B+. The tests felt to me like way easier 3100 tests with with very slight 4271 knowledge required. They almost all questions were multiple choice/true false and worth a fair number of points. Wouldn't recommend unless you need a low work ECE elective, are confident with 3100 material and can take tests carefully.",ECE 4271,464
Stephen Wicker,2,3,2,"Prof Wicker was a really nice professor and super understanding like when our prelim was super hard and people did not do well, he said he could weigh the final paper more (there was no final exam, but a 5 page final paper which was pretty easy to write). However, I took this class because I heard it was easy and interesting, but I did not find the material interesting at all. If you like telecomms or think you'd be interested, I would recommend this course, but otherwise I would not take it. There is a lot of textbook readings, and I could barely slug my way through them because I found the material very boring.",ECE 4450,465

This proved to be this course's greatest strength as well as its greatest weakness; I learned a little about a lot, but I don't feel like I've learned all that much in one area. I also wish the course talked a bit more about the ECE component of robotics; most of the course focused on MechE topics (kinematics, joints) and statistics (probability, inference, could call this CS).

Professor Alexander is very good at explaining concepts and always willing to help.",ECON 1001,478
Stephanie Thomas,2,3,2,"I had a rigorous AP Micro HS course so the content itself wasn't difficult. However, the lectures were dull, the exams were way beyond the practice exams, and Thomas was generally unaccommodating. An example: she had homework originally assigned to be due during the Semifinals study period/break; someone asked to change the due date and so she made it due 3 days earlier.",ECON 1110,479
Stephanie Thomas,2,2,2,Took it with Thomas (FA 2020). The best thing is that the tests are all multiple choice (and open book because of COVID). I learned everything from the textbook and the lectures are honestly useless. Be sure to look into logistics when taking this class with Thomas. She has different grading rules than the other prof teaching it in the same semester and it's not fair. The hw assignments have 3 attempts and she takes the average instead of the highest score like the other professor does. And she doesn't give out A+ in this class.,ECON 1110,479

Stephanie Thomas,3,3,2,Did not have any AP econ before.  Thomas basically teaches parts of the textbook in her lecture. The textbook and lectures would often not cover the things needed to complete the homework and exams. ,ECON 1110,479
Stephanie Thomas,3,2,2,"Thomas was definitely not as bad as some of these reviews notes.

Nicholas Sanders,4,3,2,"Sanders was a really good professor. Lectures were a bit boring but office hours really helped. Also doing the practice exams before each prelim and final was really helpful because we don't do any practice during lecture.

Stephanie Thomas,3,3,3,"A lot of people are saying Thomas is unaccommodating, but she was really helpful to me early in the semester even when I did not have proper SDS accommodations. Reach out and she will try to care as much as she can. This class was mediocre for me. I did micro in high school, so I did not attend the lectures. There is a lot of homework every week, and I did the readings to help with that. I thought the first two exams were fair, but the final was ridiculously hard and was not really representative of the content she said it would cover (much more content after prelim #2, barely anything else and if there is it's all easy questions). The final definitely left a bad taste in my mouth, and she always has a lot of questions that require a lot of thinking and are aimed to trick you.",ECON 1110,479

As a student, you can tell that he is extremely passionate about the material which makes you excited to learn as well.  Although lectures are not required, I would highly suggest going.

I enjoyed the class and found that Wissink's transition to the online platform was also very smooth, I was able to continue learning in her class at about the same level I was able to in person and the class was still enjoyable. The topics were sometimes complex, however, if you stayed on top of understanding the lectures, going to discussion, and doing the weekly homeworks it is a very doable class. The professor also provided additional study tools before the exam which made studying for the exams much easier. Overall, I enjoyed this class and thought it had a medium workload.",ECON 1110,479
Jennifer Wissink,3,3,3,"I took Microeconomics with Professor Wissink. She doesn't get the greatest reviews but I found her caring and very methodical.

In terms of human decency she shows absolutely none. The difference between the two sections (Sanders and Thomas) were astronomical. Our median was a B, Sanders' was an A. Sanders gave his students 4 different options for grading all of which put different weights on different aspects of the course to account for the difficulty of the pandemic. Thomas gave none of that, even when she was asked with well reasoned emails, or posts on Piazza, she simply replied ""No."" If I could give her a 0 I would.

Olanrewaju Akinsiku,-,2,-,"Took in Fall 2018 with Breanna Leslie-Sky (ignore the professor listed elsewhere for this response if there's a secondary professor). She was a wonderful teacher, and I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone that desires support and attention from their instructor. The essays (4 graded, 1 pass/fail) were very doable and got progressively lengthier over time (from 2-3 pages to 5-7 pages), but the workload was much less than my peers' FWS courses. The course content was bland at times, but I enjoyed reading the graphic novels. You should be able to get an A (or at least an A-) if you come to every lecture prepared (by completing the reading, which takes about 30 minutes prior to each lecture) and ready to learn &amp; participate, in addition to spending some time writing thoughtful essays. Breanna is always willing to help :)",ENGL 1134,516

We also watched and analyzed 1-2 movies related to detectives and mysteries.",ENGL 1147,517

Cathy Caruth,5,3,3,I had the class with Alice Rhee on Asian American Food Writing. It was a pretty fun and interesting topic on food and writing about food.

The workload is weekly readings for discussion on Mondays and then like 3 or 4 essays/short-prompts.,ENGL 1158,518
Derrick Spires,4,2,2,"I took the Hamilton's America seminar of the course and it was very interesting. The class challenged the way I think about media and was very interesting.

In this class, you both read and write a wide range of pieces, such as critical reviews, place narratives, etc. Grading is clear and based on the work you do, so anyone can earn an A if they want. Overall, an interesting class covering fresh topics that will gives you a new perspective; I recommend this class.",ENGL 1158,518
Molly MacVeagh,5,2,3,"Fictions of Attention was a great class. The assigned readings were never too much and were a pretty interesting read. You get to write personal essays and literary critiques, so you don't get bored of writing the same format over and over again. You also gain some insight into attention and mindfulness and improve as a writer. I really recommend this class!",ENGL 1158,518
Lily Codera,2,3,3,"I had Professor Weena Pun, whose name is not listed here. This class was definitely beneficial, and Ms. Pun was definitely understanding.

Christine Vines,5,2,2,"My professor is Rogelio Juarez.  Our session is really chill, 4 essays in one semester. It is not hard to get a good grade as long as you have a good attitude. Our readings are pretty short as this class is ""short stories"" (about 10 pages per reading) and we often have 2 readings per week (so one session does not have HW). We talked a lot about science fictions which was largely my interest and I got introduced to a very STEM and logical way of looking at literature and essays which blows my mind away(our teacher adapts the class to tailor the fact that more than half of the class are engineering students). Please seriously consider taking and loving this course!",ENGL 1170,520
Carlos Gomez,4,1,1,"I took this course in F20 with Carlos Gomez, who was an engaging professor. There was a reading before every class which was never super long, and class discussions were interesting.

Overall, a fun and good course I would recommend.",ENGL 1170,520

Alice Turski,5,3,3,"The workload for this class was very good, as the professor was very accommodating and if we did not finish discussing a story in class it would be pushed to the next class/if something was released late the due date for the writing would also be pushed over. The grading was also very clear, although the rubric can seem vague,  asking questions about the rubric and meeting with the professor for any questions as well clarifies what you need to do and her grading is generally very clear and as objective as possible to make sure no one is graded unfairly. I would definitely recommend this class, as the class meeting two times a week made it more manageable, and the readings, while both short and long, were also manageable and possible to do in a short amount of time if necessary. While time management is still needed to meet the deadlines for writing (especially since you only meet two times and do not have that constant reminder), this class will definitely be in your favor.",ENGL 1170,520
Christine Vines,3,3,3,"My professor was Alice. I really enjoyed being taught by this professor because she always sparked my interests.

Samson Jardine,5,1,1,"Took S20. FWS usually varies tremendously by professor, but Samson Jardine's class is very easy. Up to one page reflections for every class with some images, which are very open ended and you just write out your thoughts, taking max 30 mins each. In class, seminar style and go around the room talking about the reflection on the images. No essays in the semester, only one final essay based on a few reflections.",ENGL 1183,521
Jennifer Rabedeau,4,2,2,"Hollow Crown: The class definitely had a lot more Shakespeare than I was expecting. The readings were a little dry and could be boring, but there wasn't that much.

Malcolm Bare,5,2,3,"Malcolm is an awesome teacher and very fun to have class with on a Monday night! I did not personally enjoy all of the music (New Romantic era) we listened to, but I could tell that each weekly listen was selected with care. We had four group projects and one final individual project. The workload will very much depend on how much you enjoy writing and creative projects, as it usually does in writing courses. The group projects were great for meeting people and making friends. He is also a fair marker and comments interesting things on your essays.",ENGL 1191,522
Adin Lears,4,3,3,"I took it with Elisabeth Strayer, it was a really nice FWS and Professor Strayer was really enthusiastic about the course content. There were around 4 papers, the first 3 were pretty short and the last one was a longer final paper. We also had weekly discussion posts, but they weren't a lot of work and we had allowed drops. Overall it wasn't super work heavy and the grading was quite lenient!",ENGL 1191,522

Rayna Kalas,4,3,3,"Kalas is a great professor. There's a lot of reading that isn't discussed in class which is a bummer, but it's a good survey course.

Anindita Banerjee,5,1,3,"100% recommend taking. The class is a great mix of different types of students from different majors. Your grade is based on attendance, participation, 2 group presentations, and a final project or essay which is completely open ended. Prof Banerjee sets up the class to encourage discussion. You read a bunch of different and cool sci fi texts, along with some great movies such as Blade Runner and The Hunger Games. Banerjee sometimes goes on hard to follow tangents, but really they aren't crucial.",ENGL 2035,524
Anindita Banerjee,-,3,-,Prof. Banerjee is an incredibly enthusiastic professor and she makes the class very enjoyable. It's not too much work and the work you do have is enjoyable (if you like scifi of course that is).,ENGL 2035,524
Anindita Banerjee,-,1,-,"Very interesting class, definitely worth taking. My class was predominantly non-humanities majors, so there were a lot of interesting perspectives which the professor always tried to bring into the discussion. Well selected texts on their own and in comparison, and Prof. Banerjee has a great deal of passion and clearly knows her area of study deeply. Class discussions always brought in new and interesting aspects. When I took it there were no prelims, no papers, just group projects, presentations and discussions and an open-ended final project. I honestly didn't realize how much I loved this class until my next semester's courses didn't measure up.",ENGL 2035,524

Charlie Green,5,3,3,"Dr. Green is one of the kindest and most accommodating professors in the English department. The workload is not heavy at all - structured readings that are very do-able. He also provides guidance for the papers due throughout the semester, and there's time in class to work on them too. Just be prepared to actively engage in discussion because the class is very heavily discussion-based where students lead the conversation and Dr. Green kind of just listens and helps facilitate. Overall, really an eye-opening course because the books are all teaching of different perspectives.",ENGL 2715,529

Joanie Mackowski,5,3,3,"As a course overall, it depends on which professor you get. I personally loved having Mackowski. She wasn't as ""easy"" as other professors from what I've heard, but she really encourages you to grow and develop your writing skills. Her prompts were unique and introspective, and forced me to step beyond my comfort zone in writing. Would def recommend if you are looking for a challenge/opportunity to grow!",ENGL 2800,531

Corey Earle,5,1,1,"Super interesting class. I took it when it was remote and really enjoyed it. There are plenty of extra credit opportunities so you can easily get an A+, or you can pass/fail the class and not even write the final paper. You don't have to go to class but it is really interesting and some of my friends were interested in listening to the lecture just to hear some fun facts about Cornell.",ENGL 2999,534
Corey Earle,5,1,1,"Highly recommend everyone to take this course. Majority of your grade is attendance, the rest is a reading response and a short final paper, with lots of extra credit opportunities.

If you've ever been curious about the history of our university or wanted to learn some cool things about the buildings you see every single day, this class is what you're looking for.

Overall, easy class that is pretty interesting and amazing for filling requirements.",ENGL 3080,535
Thomas Hill,3,2,2,"If you are self-motivated and are okay with a less-than-clear syllabus, this is the class for you. The sagas aren't all that hard to read, and some of them are actually really interesting. Prof Tom loves the subject and really wants the class to lead, so he doesn't really have lesson plans. Good option for English majors who don't want to read Shakespeare for the Pre-1800s requirement. Attendance isn't required but participation is part of the grade",ENGL 3080,535

I can see how this course is necessary since I came to the realization that writing properly is esoteric knowledge for engineers, but the way it's taught is completely fkin bonkers. Tedious dogsht assignments, boring lectures where she spends sweet time reading straight off the slides and disregarding all the concepts in the textbook about engaging slides that she LITERALLY MAKES US READ and QUIZZES us on it, and the busywork in-class assignments that she makes us do... this is the moment when I realized that I'm not at this shthole for quality education; I'm here to buy a trendy Cornell degree. I really should've gone to a state school or something, not because I can't handle myself here, but because my state school has a higher quality of education and thus more bang for my buck.

Prelims were alright if you went to the review sessions.,ENGRD 2020,544
Jingjie Yeo,3,4,4,"An important engineering course to understanding the basic physics of materials. Lectures are fine but the examples gone over in class are often much easier than hw problems- the textbook actually has a lot more useful example problems. If you can do and understand the hw by yourself, you will be fine on the exams. If you find them challenging, go to OH. It was a fairly difficult course, but that's engineering for you. There is a lot of hw too but they do prepare you for the exams. Overall, I think I learned the material well enough from this course.",ENGRD 2020,544

Atieh Moridi,2,5,5,Taken Sp21- Overall organization was not great. Online homework assignments were assigned without any announcements or notice and usually supposed to be done before the due date if you didn't want to fall behind in the discussion schedule. Response time for questions was long and often materials needed for studying for prelims or to complete assignments were posted only a day or two before the assignment due date. TAs did try to help but overall the course structure/organization made it difficult.,ENGRD 2020,544
Hadas Ritz,2,4,4,"Ritz and Yeo weren't bad professors, but their lecture examples were often much easier than homework problems. With the weekly online homework assignments and weekly problem sets, you'll often have a good amount of work. I personally feel as if the class is really not accommodating and the grading scheme can really set you up to fail/ do much worse than you're supposed to. Despite being in the middle of a pandemic, Ritz really didn't want to change the course format that much and made office hours/ group collaboration outside of class a must. I strongly recommend that you find a good group of people to work with in the course and go to office hours as early as possible",ENGRD 2020,544

For group projects, make sure to pick a reliable partner or partners and maintain open lines of communication.  That being said, I had a lot of fun in the class.

Andrew Myers,2,5,5,"I actually dropped the class at the last day I could before getting a W. This is probably one of the best (if not the best) CS classes for understanding what development is. You learn how (read: are forced) to implement all aspects of software dev, from original ideas and design to debugging  and using your IDE to its maximum potential. However, the class is HARD. If you even think you can procrastinate, you're done for. The first project doesn't tell you anything about the difficulty. If you struggle on the first project, drop immediately. On the first 2 or 3 projects you can get away with putting things off a little, but starting with project 2, it gets hard fast. If you already have significant experience writing code and debugging (in Java), or if you are REALLY self-motivated and able to learn FAST, I definitely recommend taking this class. It will prepare you for the rest of the CS major (and probably your career) better than any other class. If you're one of those students who wants all As or is worried about grad school and need that 4.3 GPA, don't bother with this class.

In this course you start with learning C in the first half, then you transition to C++. In this class, I felt like I like I learned so much.

Batten is an amazing lecturer but he is also detailed orriented so you gotta make sure you check everything and really solidify your understanding of the material. You definitely come out a much better programmer, very confident in my abilities now.         BUT you go through war to get there.

The content was literally two main fluid mechanics properties that could have been taught in 2 weeks but it's stretched out to a whole semester. Only kinda useful content would be the ANSYS program (basically CAD) we learned the basics of. The hw using it was basically following a step by step tutorial and I can see how it would be useful in the future but you are only taught the very very basics.,ENGRD 2202,549

The weekly homework can have mildly challenging problems and the labs in the second half of the semester can take a long time to debug. However, going to office hours for labs helps a lot, but you would need to start the labs early, or else the office hours are usually very crowded. The random partners for labs can be very annoying if you don't get paired with someone good. But exams are easy if you just do the practice ones they give you.",ENGRD 2300,552

Labs are worth 30% of our grade which is greater than our prelims which are 20% each. But they TAKE FOREVER. There have been weeks were we had something due 4 different days of the week which is kind of absurd. However, he is super understanding and after some complaints, he spread the assignments out more. The prelims are also very similar to the practice he gives you and are pretty fair but they don't give great partial credit. I'm taking it fall 2020 and the exams were in person open note which really REALLY helps. I would suspect that without notes this class would be mostly memorization. Overall the class is okay and the prof is pretty cool!",ENGRD 2300,552
David Albonesi,4,3,3,The prof goes through lectures extremely fast and it was hard to keep up with the material. The good thing about online classes is that I can always watch the recordings later. The worst thing is that we don't get to choose our own lab groups. My first partner always pushes off the meeting time we had previously settled on. My second partner either doesn't do what he promised to do what does them the very last minute. I ended up doing most of the labs by myself.,ENGRD 2300,552

Professor Craighead is also super understanding and kind and will meet with you outside of class if you really do need extra help. Unfortunately, he is retiring after this semester :( Otherwise, it's a pretty chill class- only 6 homework sets and 2 prelims-- no final. The content itself is also pretty interesting and it's been cool learning about other types of engineering applications outside of my CS classes.",ENGRD 2520,553
John March,3,2,3,"March was very generous with the grading. You should complete all the problem sets and study for exams, but I would recommend prioritizing engineering core courses.

The extra content that March teaches is can be interesting, but 90% of the class zones off anyway.",ENGRD 2600,554
Mingming Wu,-,2,-,"This class should be really amazing but when Mingming Wu was teaching it it fell quite short.  The course covers very interesting concepts (for a biological engineer) but did not go beyond surface-level, which was disappointing at times.  Although assignments are not difficult they are time-consuming and she tended to stack assignments together with very little sympathy for students who struggled or were overwhelmed.

I thought numbers would be fairly easy and straightforward, but Sidney Resnick made it possible for me to never like looking at any non-discrete real number ever again. The dude is senile, has a piss-poor attitude that clearly didn't hold up in industry which is why he came to academia, the use of R in this class didn't teach me anything and I ended up copying code to finish assignments than trying to understand it because the turnover rate for problem sets was so high. Thank God this man is finally old enough to call it quits, otherwise you would've been guaranteed to rip your hair out every Wednesday in Rhodes for a complete semester.

The psets can be time-consuming but you have 2 weeks to do them so if you spread it out you should be fine! Office hours are now recorded so you can watch TAs explain how to do certain problems.

The weekly problem sets aren't too difficult especially if you go to office hours. Additionally, we had large group projects that weren't bad and our prelims had practice prelims that were super similar. We did transition online (spring 2020) and the professors were incredibly accommodating. I do have to say as some super into sustainability, it's more of the science behind it rather than ""trendier"" side of sustainability.",ENGRI 1130,567

R. Van Dover,3,2,3,Lecturers were very dull at times and made me feel tired. Although some of the material is very interesting. Van Dover was also particularly attentive to helping students feel at ease and was kind to us. Office hour TA's were also great at talking to students and helping students work through problem sets.,ENGRI 1140,568
R. Van Dover,3,3,3,"Took this class asych because of the time difference. Prof Van Dover is very knowledgeable and the TAs were very helpful (although I didn't take advantage of this as I should have).  The remote lectures are technically synchronous, but the lecture sections are combined remote + in-person. What this meant was that the professor lectured to the in-person students, while a TA was in charge of the Zoom meeting. This meant that any questions asked were usually delayed, since the TA had to jot them down and wait for the professor to pause his lecture. On the other hand, in-person students could ask questions live and have them answered immediately. As for workload, the first 2/3 of the semester is much easier than the end, but that's because I stopped watching the lectures and tried to  learn by googling material. For the beginning, the material is fairly basic and even if you don't understand, you can just google concepts and get a surface level understanding. However, when more complicated topics come up, it's near-impossible to learn without watching the lectures or asking questions. If you plan to take this class, make sure you ask any",ENGRI 1140,568
R. Van Dover,-,4,-,The first half of the semester was more of an intro mat sci course and we only got to sustainable energy in the second half so I found the course name to be a bit misleading. Umbach's lectures can be very fast at times and lose you easily but office hours are super helpful in actually understanding the material. The problem sets are relatively long and can be very difficult if you don't go to office hours. There were frequent iClicker questions in the beginning of the semester but tapered off towards the end.,ENGRI 1140,568
Kenneth Hover,5,3,3,"This class was super fun and I felt like I learned a lot. Ken is super nice and makes an effort to connect with his students.

Kenneth Hover,5,2,2,"Took with Ken Hover online during F20, and the class was very fun and goes through a lot of basic core civil engineering disciplines. Professor Hover is very nice and cares about the students and tries to talk to them. Course is a bit disorganized with the homework postings and the stuff we need to do the homework, but the workload is not much and prelims are fairly easy. Sometimes there are quizzes in class, but they are easy and same as lecture or homework material, so go to lecture and do the homework. You should also be good with the prelims if you do so. There are also labs, but you do not need reports or anything from them, mostly a learning experience, such as welding or making concrete.",ENGRI 1160,569

The course content is like the first few weeks of Statics (ENGRD 2020) spread out over a semester, so although it wasn't too fast-paced or difficult, it's given me a great foundation for Statics. The guest lectures helped me get a good idea of the breadth of MechE, and the design project was fun. I didn't think the workload was bad at all (maybe 6 short psets, 4 or so lab reports, 3 exams), but I heard it might've been heavier than other ENGRIs.

Also, Albonesei covers the topics again in the lectures and clears any confusing points as well as goes over problem sets which are helpful.

I took this class and ECE 2300 together, and found that it helped solidify my understanding of the material in both classes.",ENGRI 1210,572
David Albonesi,4,3,3,"The difficulty of the course comes from the fact that the majority of the material isn't something students have generally seen before.

Every week, the homework is at least 100 multiple choice questions. If memorization is not your thing, beware. I'm sure that people who either are good at memorization or fine with really grinding to retain content thrive in this class, but it consistently beat me down.

Material is pretty easy to understand and as long as you do the work you will pass. Dr. Loss and the TAs give clear instructions with assignments and when to sign up for prototype sessions.

Alicia Orta-Ramirez,-,3,-,"Heads up, this is the ""ice cream class,"" where the special Dairy Bar flavor comes from each year. Its reputation precedes it, but this year it felt very unorganized. The ice cream project groups were huge and scheduling was a big problem, and our group wasn't prepared well for the ice cream making session. I attended every lecture, but still the final exam was unexpectedly difficult, with a lot of short answer questions. (It might have been easier for Food Sci majors?) However, grading is pretty relaxed in this course, as I did poorly on the final but still ended up with an A- overall.",FDSC 1101,591
Julie Goddard,4,1,1,"While I wish I had more FDSC-involved classes this semester, I still really enjoyed this class. It provided helpful career skills like how to network and make a resume.

Julie Goddard,2,1,1,"This class is for some reason 2 hours long for no reason. We don't really do much, but it is a nice class to meet more fdsc majors. We do like one networking project and make linkedin profiles. Overall, class is easy but just long and dull.",FDSC 1102,592
Dennis Miller,5,1,1,"This class is very informative and really changed how I viewed my own diet and eating habits. It's also an easy class, and we only get 2 graded papers (3-5 pages each) and a quiz every lecture based on the previous lecture and the reading.

Carl Batt,2,4,1,"Wasn't a fan of Prof. Batt's teaching style. Some students love him, some hate him because he has a very informal way of conducting class. In-class activities were executed with very little organization, much to the anxiety of many students. However, many of them were interesting and required considerable data analysis which was a cool feature. Occasional incidents where Prof. Batt was unfairly harsh about students not understanding directions because directions were given unclearly. Subject material is much more applicable to food science majors so I would not recommend this course to Microbiology concentrations. Big emphasis on group projects. Tests were disproportionately difficult to the rest of the course and relied on 90% regurgitation of lecture material. The difficulty is mostly in that there is a ton of lecture material to digest.",FDSC 3940,596
Robin Dando,5,3,2,"Prof. Dando is super nice and knowledgeable and has real-world experience in his field. Lectures were clear, focused, interesting, and applicable. Homeworks were primarily focused on stats he usually didn't explain in-depth in class (but that he provided notes for), while exams were more focused on what we learned in class. There was about one homework per week and two exams in total. I didn't take the lab section (I took it for 2 credits), so I'm not sure what that portion of the course is like.",FDSC 4100,597

As per your typical intro class, we explored a wide breadth of topics and didn't quite go into depth into any of them, but everything was fascinating! We talked about disability, migration, environmental justice, intersectionality, and more! Courseload was pretty average-- some discussion posts, weekly readings, 2 interviews, midterm research paper, and take-home final exam. ",FGSS 2010,600
Jane Juffer,-,3,-,"This class is amazing for getting a solid base for learning about these topics! Homework is primarily readings, which can sometimes be pretty long / dense but are always valuable.

Stacey Langwick,4,3,4,"I took this class with professor Langwick. The material is super interesting and I would definitely recommend it to future doctors to learn more about how the role of medicine impacts society and culture. It is a good introduction to medical anthropology. However, this class is a lot of work. There were no prelims but all essays and readings every week. Professor Langwick doesn't allow laptops and she makes you print out the reading for every class and it is around 10 pages. It was bad for the environment. Also there are pop quizzes for the readings. I took it spring 2020 so the second half was impacted by COVID and there was a lot less work.",FGSS 2468,602

Saida Hodzic,5,2,3,"I really like this class. Prof. Hodzic is really interesting and leads very open and insightful discussions in class. There were no prelims in the class which was nice but instead, there were two medium-length essays and one final research paper.  TAs are very helpful and there is plenty of time to do the papers so if you stay on top of it it's not very hard to manage. Readings can be a lot at times but skimming through them usually does the trick and you learn a lot in lecture about each reading.",FGSS 2468,602
Samantha Sheppard,-,2,-,"Professor Sheppard is a great teacher, and the topic was really interesting! HW was a lot of reading, but most texts were interesting anyway.

Margaret Washington,3,4,4,This class was a very interesting class and I learned so much from this class that I still use to this day.

Readings started off theoretical/difficult but got much easier as we progressed from young children's media to teenage media. Loved reading children's books and looking at media/literature from a totally new perspective.  Essays had multiple options and there is one presentation you can propose and do any time during the semester based on which unit it lines up with. Class is primarily discussion-based. Prof. Juffer is extremely kind and willing to help with concerns about essays, readings and projects.",FGSS 3591,606
Francine Blau,3,4,3,Professor Blau knows her stuff - she is one of the leading academics in terms of female labor and economics. Course material is very economics-technical and conceptual though Blau does try to include real-world applications and examples. Make sure you are very very thorough in the open-book exam (my semester was impacted by COVID) and that all relevant details are included. I remember a lot of kids in my class got points taken off here and there because they omitted something. Lecture can be really dry and it's easy to tune out but as long as you do the readings you should be fine. Group project was not fun if you were assigned bad group members.,FGSS 4460,607

Be prepared to speak in class, he's not afraid of calling on people who don't seem to be paying attention. One or two big speaking tasks are very manageable and you have plenty of time to prepare beforehand. Readings/essays aren't too difficult, but can pile up sometimes so be sure to keep up. Online daily homework is very easy. Textbook is expensive, save money and get the online version (sadly you have to buy the pass for the online homework so you won't be able to get away with buying nothing).

Elise is a fantastic professor who not only teaches well but makes the course a lot of fun. This course strikes me as the kind of small humanities course where everyone who tries and does decently well gets an A. The workload is extremely light, but it's important to note that how much work you'll need to do will vary drastically with your French ability. I took the course without having taken its corequisites and spent less than ten hours on its homework throughout the semester. I'm pretty sure my friend, who's conversationally fluent in French, spent less than two. Overall, the course is a lot of fun and very well-taught, however, as it meets only once a week, there's not sufficient scope for learning or improving a whole lot.",FREN 2091,611
Ti Alkire,5,3,3,"Took the course this semester and loved it overall! The class is really small (only 10 people), so there is a lot of individualized attention, even over Zoom.

However, my french pronunciation improved a lot after taking this course and I learned a lot overall. Would recommend!",FREN 2092,612

Laurent Ferri,5,1,1,"Not sure how I stumbled into this hidden gem of a course, but Professor Ferri is an absolute wealth of knowledge about medieval books, history and artifacts and was clear when taking this course that he was excited each and every day to teach us his field. To take a course in a subject from not only the curator of Cornell's RMC collection, but also one of the leading experts in the field was a true pleasure. There was functionally no homework and a 10 page final paper, but the paper practically wrote itself. The course offers students the ability to actually handle some of the rarest and most interesting objects in Cornell's collection. Overall, one of the best courses I've taken at Cornell and I highly recommend it to anyone who has the time.",FREN 2350,615

Denise Green,3,2,3,"It's an enjoyable class if fashion genuinely interests you. The prelim is almost identical to the things discussed in class. If you pay attention, then you should do well.

If you haven't sewn before, this class will be the perfect speed for you if you pay attention to the demos. If you have sewn clothing before, this class will be easier. You should be able to get all the projects done in class for the most part. If you find yourself with extra time, definitely work on your own stuff.",FSAD 1450,621

Wegner was a great teacher and gives good feedback. Grading was unclear as he never graded assignments. A diverse array of readings were offered, not only European stories but ones from indigenous, Black American, and other cultures.

Douglas McBride,4,3,3,"This FWS (taught by Soren Larsen) was pretty interesting and engaging, and I would definitely recommend it. We focused mostly on in-class discussions and wrote a couple of essays throughout the semester, but we also met at the Johnson Museum of Art a few times. Some assigned readings required more time and effort than others, but the fairy tales we read were generally fun to read. I would have appreciated more verbal feedback on essays, but a majority of the class was spent on developing our analytical skills.",GERST 1109,627
Jordan Thomson,4,2,3,"Generally more reading than writing (which is what I wanted personally). There are some weekly discussion prompts on canvas that corresponds to the readings, but they're easy and interesting.

Suzanne Mettler,4,2,3,"I learned a lot about the basics of American politics, a lot of which I learned from my AP US Government class in high school. I also learned some extra information which is highly centralized on polarization in Congress and the question if American democratic institutions are working in the American society. Professor Mettler is very straightforward, thinks in a very data-based way (which I like), and is very nice (she tries to engage the students in lecture to participate in class). Workload: 2 papers to write, readings, and a few short mini hw news assigments, very manageable.",GOVT 1111,637
Nicolas van de Walle,4,2,3,"This class is a great intro to world politics, understanding more about the institutions in which countries around the world govern with. I would say sometimes the lectures get a bit dry because a lot of the content would be a repeat from the readings; however I do really enjoy the lectures (as a summary of each lecture topic) when he talks about different case studies like the yellow vest movement, Korean chaebols, Germany's regional tensions, etc. Van de Walle is a very nice professor, he's like your nice grandpa that can tell you a lot of good stories about world politics, and he pauses throughout the lecture to ask if anyone have questions. It is helpful to look at the powerpoint slides before the prelims, and prelims itself are very straightforward as long as you study. I had no homework from sections, as long as I did the readings and discussed about it during class, I did fine.",GOVT 1313,638
Nicolas van de Walle,2,3,4,"I took this class thinking I might double major in government, but it deterred me from doing so. The readings are really dense and not super interesting, same with the lectures even though van de Walle is awesome as a person. Your experience and grade in the class also depends a lot on your TA; my section was graded a lot harder than others and required more weekly homework than other sections (who had no homework).

Depending on the TA they can be harsh, but the workload is not too intense - one prelim, one 2-3 pg paper, one 8-10 pg paper, and a final. Kreps always tied in current events to the course material which helped me undestand and apply it more. The readings can be very dense but can also be skimmed.",GOVT 1817,640

Sarah Kreps,1,3,3,"Found Kreps class to be way too long - I fell asleep for most classes. Honestly, her most interesting class was her guest lecturer on drones. TAs can be harsh graders depending on which TA you get - make sure you participate in discussions. Concepts discussed are very very theoretical, I guess it is something you can expect from an International Relations class. Time management is key on exams, which is made up of ID questions (explain the significance of a term) and essay question(s). Readings can be a lot and very dense.",GOVT 1817,640
Anna Haskins,5,2,2,"The course is really interesting and very well structured! Prof. Haskins is one of the best lecturers at Cornell and makes every effort to interact with the class. The sections are mandatory, but very engaging and have good group discussions. The content itself is great and covers important social topics, some things can be surprising to know too! There are a lot of readings, but I just skim through them. We have to write a reflection paper at the end of the unit and have a weekly quiz. No prelims or finals this semester, but we do have to attend two Cornell events (virtual) related to the content and write about them.",GOVT 2225,641
Anna Haskins,4,1,2,It is a really interesting class.,GOVT 2225,641
Anna Haskins,-,3,-,"my favorite class I've taken at Cornell so far!! really interesting content with a professor that is extremely engaging and great with all her students! our only assignments are to do readings (but you can honestly get away with reading the big important ones &amp; just lightly skimming others) &amp; a simply 1 page memo that can be done in 30 minutes, every week. it's not hard to get A's on her exams as long as you review in depth for all materials, but it's easy to do so if you attend lectures &amp; look at her posted slides. sections are really chill too. also a TON of extra credit!",GOVT 2225,641
Anna Haskins,-,2,-,Pretty easy if you go to class and do the readings (they're kind of a lot but really helpful). Section is mandatory but pretty interesting. You have to write a one page (double-spaced) memo each week about the readings and theres 2 in class prelims and one take home final. Professor Haskins is super nice and there are a ton of opportunities for extra credit. It's also a part of the inequality studies minor.,GOVT 2225,641
Anna Haskins,-,3,-,Haskins is wonderful and the class is a great introduction to inequality issues. Everything is straight-forward. Have to do a weekly memo but aside from that there's only the prelims.,GOVT 2225,641
Sabrina Karim,5,2,3,"The class material is very engaging, but often the lectures seem geared to underclassmen. The interactive activities are fun, and help explain complicated political theories.",GOVT 2264,642
Rachel Riedl,3,1,1,"This class focused more on breadth rather than deep and briefly touched on a different global issue each week. The lectures were also structured more like discussions, which was a bit disorienting since it was a large class that was done both in-person and online (the professor would teach in person but have zoom open for students who were studying remotely). The assessments for the class were also largely based on independent research and included a presentation and a final paper.",GOVT 2274,643
Christopher Way,-,3,-,I liked the professor connected the readings to current events in Europe and the assignments weren't that frequent compared to my other liberal arts courses. There's two big papers assigned in this course so it's helpful to go to office hours to plan out the essays.,GOVT 2553,644
Peter Katzenstein,5,3,3,"Wonderful class, learned a lot about IR from one of the greats. Participation is a huge (30%) part of the grade and a final paper makes up another (40%) of your grade but in between the large assignments the class isn't too bad",GOVT 2817,645
Peter Katzenstein,5,4,4,Amazing class on international relations! Highly recommend. There is a fair amount of reading for this course but it is pretty standard for a Government class. Very rewarding and PK is an incredibly knowledgeable teacher.,GOVT 2817,645
Peter Katzenstein,5,4,3,I took this class Fall 2019. I am not a GOV major and took this class out of interest. PK is a great lecturer and the topics addressed are very interesting. He facilitates class discussions and focuses on creating a safe space for minorities and female students to speak. It is defiantly one of the most enjoyable and informative classes I have taken at Cornell.,GOVT 2817,645
Peter Katzenstein,5,2,2,"This was one of the most informative and interesting classes I have taken at Cornell.  Professor Katzenstein is truly an expert on the material that he teaches, and is able to convey robust and complex arguments in an interesting way.  I feel like I have walked away from the class with a far more nuanced and in depth understanding of America and the world at large than I had at the beginning of the semester.  The policy memos and final paper can be a bit open ended, but the TA's do a great job of adding some structure to the assignments, and are more than willing to cooperate with you and guide you through the paper.  Definitely take this class if you get the chance!",GOVT 2817,645
Jamila Michener,5,3,3,Funny prof and interesting class! Had to complete an in-class midterm and write some papers. There's also an interview project but it was very enjoyable!,GOVT 3032,646
Jamila Michener,5,4,4,I took GOVT 3032 online during Fall 2020. Professor Michener modified the course and assignments slightly for COVID-19 and it was really appreciated. I loved her lectures and found the readings and assignments to be really interesting and engaging! Definitely would recommend if you are interested in the policy process.,GOVT 3032,646
Jamila Michener,5,3,2,"Loved this class and Professor Michener! She really cares about what she teaches and her own personal research. Super interesting content about the policy process and at the end of the class content, you start with applications to current events and issues. Despite being an upper-level class, I took it my first year (FA '20) and it was quite reasonable in terms of work and content. The final is tough (about 3 response questions, 5 pages each, need to complete in 2-3 days) but should not be a deterrent from the class, especially since there are still few assignments overall.",GOVT 3032,646
Jamila Michener,5,4,4,"I took GOVT 3032 online during Fall 2020-- the assignments were modified slightly for COVID which was really appreciated! Prof Michener was a fantastic professor, I loved her lectures and found the readings and assignments to be really interesting and engaging. Definitely would recommend if you are interested in learning about the policy process!",GOVT 3032,646
Joseph Margulies,3,4,4,Professor Margulies knows his stuff and is very open to student discussion. There can be a lot of reading but he was very kind in adapting to student needs this semester. 3 papers that are not crazy long but graded strictly.,GOVT 3121,647
Dawn Chutkow,4,3,3,I enjoyed the class and I think Professor Chutkow does a good job in laying a solid foundation when studying law. The experience would have been a lot better if it was synchronous and in-person.,GOVT 3131,648
Dawn Chutkow,4,3,3,Prof Chutkow is super interesting and entertaining in lecture. I have learned so much. The assignments are very doable and related to class content. Readings are a reasonable amount and gone over in class.,GOVT 3131,648
Dawn Chutkow,3,4,3,"Professor Chutkow has a sense of humor and she relates well with students. Class is not too bad; sometimes the legal reasoning can get a little convoluted (especially in terms of tort law) so make sure you follow with the readings and lectures. Grade primarily is based on two hypothetical problem sets, in which you are presented with a set of facts and must apply legal reasoning/facts from cases in the readings to your own set of facts. Would suggest you go to office hours for assistance as these are graded pretty harshly. Overall, the class is not impossible but make sure you get help if you need it.",GOVT 3131,648
Dawn Chutkow,5,3,3,"Took this class Spring 2019 and absolutely loved it. Learned a lot about a number of different types of legal issues and cases to explain them. Professor Chutkow is a phenomenal teacher who consistently engaged all the students in lecture despite being a large class. Homework consisted of short readings throughout the class, along with 2 ""Problem Sets"" instead of prelims, which were essays you had to write explaining how a given court case should be decided based on lecture material.",GOVT 3131,648
Dawn Chutkow,5,2,2,"This class provides an excellent and comprehensive survey of the American legal system, covering 1st Amendment issues, court procedure, civil, criminal, regulatory and administrative law, public benefits, and the Supreme Court. In addition, Prof. Chutkow is honestly the best professor I've had at Cornell -- she's always able to present the material in an engaging and relevant way and makes lecture 100% worth going to. There are two case analysis homework assignments, occasional section meetings that substitute for lectures, and multiple-choice exams. Definitely one of the most rewarding classes I've taken.",GOVT 3131,648
Dawn Chutkow,5,3,3,"Took it Spring 2019. Workload isn't too bad, it's two 6 page essays answering 3-4 problems, and a non-cumulative multiple choice final. Professor is very fun and engaging, and presents the material incredibly well. Chutkow is also very friendly and open to help you, and definitely knows what she's talking about. Only con is you have to work on the problem set/essays ahead of time, as around three days before it's due she forbids any more questions to her about them.",GOVT 3131,648
Jamila Michener,2,4,5,"I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone. While this class is extremely informative (BUT SOLELY THROUGH THE READINGS) and teaches you about a crucial topic in America today, it is simply not worth it. We basically learn ALL the material by ourselves through readings, sometimes up to 200 pages per night. The readings are ridiculous - the WORST I've ever had for a class &amp; it's as if Professor Michener didn't really care whether or not we had readings for other classes. On top of that, we BARELY discuss the readings in class. Prof. Michener doesn't really lecture - it's more like she preaches in class. Her lectures are hardly informative but I guess they are empowering?? But empowering is hardly enough. The TAs are pretty nice, but honestly don't really care that much.",GOVT 3152,649
Jamila Michener,5,3,4,"Professor Michener is one of the best professors on campus. This course is very interesting because we have tons of guest speakers ranging from formerly incarcerated people, to prosecutors and lawyers. While this has some heavy ready workload, it is very worth it. We also touch on sensitive topics of homelessless, trauma, and mental health... all related to the carceral web. I highly recommend this course!",GOVT 3152,649
Peter Enns,5,1,2,Both Enns and Schuldt taught this class when I took it and I loved it! The professors are so good and very clearly understand what was going on. You really get to research whatever you want and it is so cool to get to submit a question to a national poll. The workload is not bad either but you do have to do the readings and answer a daily question.,GOVT 3189,650
Dawn Chutkow,5,3,3,"Super fascinating class, papers are kind of hard but its beyond interesting. The papers are super fun but sometimes difficult.  A must take for anybody remotely interested in law.",GOVT 3281,651
Dawn Chutkow,5,3,3,"Professor is very charismatic and passionate about the material she teaches, and this makes the class much more enjoyable. Material has a slight overlap with her other class, but generally the two classes cover different topics. There were  readings every class, two problem sets and a non-cumulative multiple choice exam. Problem sets were tedious but not terrible, but exam was very tough and made you look at exact wording of question to figure out correct answer. Despite this, would recommend the class to anyone vaguely interested in the Supreme court or Law School.",GOVT 3281,651
Alexandra Cirone,4,2,3,"Took it fall 2018. Workload consisted of two 1500 word essays, one 5000 word essay, and a take home final exam. Prof is very passionate about the material. She is also very willing to work with you if you need to potentially extend an essay deadline. Only bad part is the sheer amount of books you had to buy. Had to buy 5 books (each $10-20), with only 3 being used more than once.",GOVT 3294,652
Daniel Schade,4,2,2,"Class is good overall. Professor Schade is pretty clearly very knowledgeable about the subject matter and is good at explaining otherwise complex subject material. Exams and grading are relatively generous but there is a decent, albeit skimmable, amount of  reading.",GOVT 3437,653
Daniel Schade,3,3,3,"This class was interesting! Professor Schade definitely  has a really good understanding of the EU and teaches you really well, a lot of what I learned is relevant to other GOVT classes. The workload was okay and the class structure is a bit odd in that tuesday was a lecture and thursday was a discussion.",GOVT 3437,653
Peter Katzenstein,5,4,5,One of the harder classes I've taken but also one of the most fulfilling and educational. PK is a great professor who truly is an expert in his field.  Get ready to read a whole lot and discuss what you read. Hardest part of the class is the 30 page essay you have to write but if you stay on top of it and utilize your TAs it doesn't turn out to be as hard as you would think it is.,GOVT 3547,654
Peter Katzenstein,5,4,5,"Took this class Fall 2019, and it was really great - I loved the participation-based format where it was student led. PK knows his stuff and he knows when to step in and help you but this class is a great way to start thinking independently and critically about a topic rather than just being talked out. Grading was half participation and half a 25-30 page essay (which had very little to do with coursework) but as long as you keep up with the internal deadlines for writing the essay (which TAs give you regular feedback on) I think it's very manageable!",GOVT 3547,654
Peter Katzenstein,5,5,5,"This is an incredible course, with the most knowlegable and supportive TAs and professor you will ever find. The course is challenging but rewarding, and you will walk away with tons of take aways.",GOVT 3547,654
Begum Adalet,5,2,3,Amazing professor who emphasizes class discussion and understanding.,GOVT 3715,655
Tracy McNulty,5,4,4,"Professor McNulty is so wonderful, easily one of the best professors I've had here. The class is definitely reading heavy, and you need to read thoroughly. You get very good and detailed feedback on papers and she is definitely very accessible for help. I absolutely loved this class and came away not only with a better understanding of the content but more confident in analyzing political theory. ",GOVT 3786,656
Ross Brann,-,2,-,"Incredible professor, and teaches the subject very well",GOVT 3977,657
Christopher Way,3,3,3,"I took this class fully virtual in fall 2020. The class was pretty unique for a government class, as we spent most of the time analyzing whether the problems with the research and studies that backed policies.  It was really interesting to look at well-known or popular policies and find the problems with their justification for existing. However, the time management of the class was not great, as some weeks had significant assignments back to back (especially during the final project) while others solely had short readings to complete. I also thought, especially because the class was virtual, some of the lectures were a bit repetitive and not that engaging.",GOVT 3999,658
Christopher Way,4,3,4,"Overall very interesting course. He does his best to make the class engaging and the material is really interesting. Readings are generally not too long but there are pop quizzes that are very specific about the readings so you have to do them well. Course isn't too much work until the end when the final project is in full swing (and he left many quizzes until that point to ensure we continued the readings). Would recommend, but don't get lulled by the easy work in the beginning.",GOVT 3999,658
Richard Bensel,5,4,4,"Amazing, highly intelligent professor who is  very accessible and teaches a really interesting class. Discussion-based seminar so participation really matters but he makes this easy by assigning a reasonable amount of reading and guiding the discussion when necessary. Obviously cares about his students and rewards effort. Govt class, but he teaches without bias and encourages students to think critically about the material. The workload was better than most 3000-level class I've taken, which says a lot because this is a 4000-level senior seminar. Assigned about 100 pages of reading a week on a topic that we then spent class discussing. 50% of grade from weekly 1 page reactions to readings + class participation and 50% from a 20-page paper about effectively whatever you want. Median grade for class was an A.",GOVT 4021,659
Tony Simons,2,3,3,Prepare to learn common sense. I swear Tony Simons curves down. He does not care about learning actual content as he revolves his classes around his research to fuel his ego. Talk about the Golden Triangle on his tests.,HADM 1150,660
Kristina Workman,5,4,4,The course was super interesting. Professor Workman is a really nice professor and feels free to chat with her. Would recommend this class.,HADM 1150,660
Kristina Workman,4,4,4,Super fun and applicable class.,HADM 1150,660
Tony Simons,3,5,4,"I had this with Tony Simons and it is basically a psychology class. I feel like it was difficult at first because he wanted the wording for his assignments and exams to be the same as how he would explain it. I HIGHLY *stressing* HIGHLY recommend going to office hours, the TAs, and going to review sessions to really grasp the material. I am not a textbook person, but I had to get a lot of stuff from the book for definitions.",HADM 1150,660
Tony Simons,2,2,2,"The class is pretty useless. In class, we do a bunch of random activities that aren't helpful at all but sometimes are kind of fun. Grading is arbitrary and you need to BS a lot.",HADM 1150,660
Kristina Workman,3,1,2,"Course was manageable and not too much work. Homework consisted of some readings and a semester-long project at the end of the semester. Professor Workman was well organized and I enjoyed the combination of psychology, human resources, and management. My biggest difficulty was with group members not participating during the final project.",HADM 1150,660

Stephani Robson,3,1,1,This is a 1 credit course that may or may not be given to students each year. It was basically a class where I learned more about the hotelie industry and how to network and connect with hotelies. There were a lot of student and guest speakers because the class is to introudce you to the hotel school and their resources.,HADM 1199,661
Mary MacAusland,4,4,4,REALLY listen to the professor! Do not fall behind.,HADM 1210,662
Mary MacAusland,4,4,2,MacAusland is an amazing professor. Her lectures are very organized and she really is rooting for her students and works hard to help them. The exams are on the harder side but she is very fair and accommodating.,HADM 1210,662
Mary MacAusland,2,5,4,"This class is literally the most difficult class for me to do. I on the verge of failing this class, but I realize that a mixture of having an online class room environment and not being able to get as much learning exposure inn lecture is what my downfall was. This is definitely one of the hardest Hotelie courses, alongside Man Acc and Finance. I wouldn't be intimidated by the work if make sure to use the book, do the practice problem, and go to office hours. Best piece of advice is DO NOT FALL BEHIND.",HADM 1210,662
Mary MacAusland,4,3,3,Professor MacAusland is very helpful. She makes sure that you are on track with the quizzes and her exams are not too hard as long as you keep up with the class. The TAs in the class are great as well. Doing homework assignments on Connect was the worst part of the class as it was expensive and didn't add any value.,HADM 1210,662
Mary MacAusland,5,4,4,"Professor MacAusland was well organized and ran the class very smoothly. She posted a schedule at the beginning of the semester with all the due dates for the homework assignments, quizzes, and prelims. The class was structured in a way where we did one chapter each week and there was ample time to meet with the TA or the professor for office hours. She made the prelim and quiz fully accessible after we took them to be used to study for the final exam. Highly recommend the class as an introduction to accounting.",HADM 1210,662
Mary MacAusland,5,3,3,Wonderful professor! love her beautiful smile,HADM 1210,662
Dave Roberts,4,3,1,"I took this class as a non-hotelie because I was thinking about transferring to the hotel school. Roberts is a really nice prof, super personable, and I enjoyed hearing about his life experiences. The course content is kind of boring, and I didn't do as well as I thought I would on the exams. However, I can attribute this to the fact that as a non-hotelie, I was not experienced in or learning excel (in other hotel courses, like i realized other hotelies did). Being able to use excel well is the key to doing well in this class on exams, and I didn't realize how useful excel was for the course until later. As a non-hotelie, it's hard to get to know people in the class since everybody is already friends/knows each other from other hotel courses. The course content was pretty boring/dry, but gave me a good window/overview into what the hotel major is like. The hotel practicum was interesting though, as I got to see how the Statler hotel worked. The class wasn't hard but I ended up not getting that great of a grade bc I didn't have the same supporting coursework as the hotelies did to help me with this class. Prof Dave Roberts was really nice, and classes were a chill/fun",HADM 1350,663
Reneta McCarthy,2,2,2,Class is somewhat boring IMO. The content is lots of memorization. The professor is a bit rude at times.,HADM 1350,663
Dave Roberts,5,3,3,"I am in love with this class. I genuinely love Professor Dave Roberts. He is a new professor and has the largest heart and passion for Marriott. I love the way he teaches as it really engages the students while we learn about the operations of the hotel industry. We are supposed to have an in person practicum where we do 6-7 hours of work in the Hotel, but it was online this semester because of COVID. Although I missed this opportunity to do it, the class taught me a lot of things that are applicable for future experiences.",HADM 1350,663
Dave Roberts,5,2,2,"Professor Roberts was a fantastic professor. Clearly quite knowledgeable in the hospitality industry and very passionate about his past work. Limited homework, two short projects, and two exams. There was also a practicum where we learned about the Statler and how a hotel functions. This is a mandatory class for hotel students, but I still enjoyed it.",HADM 1350,663

I feel like it was a lot of work in regards to learning the topic on your own and then going into the lectures/OH to review and put what you learned into practice. I felt a bit lost in lecture sometimes, but the TAs and forming study groups was the best option.",HADM 1410,664
Adam Walden,2,2,4,"I had Professor Adam W and it was a decent class. There was a lot of busy work that seemed easy to do, but he is the kind of professor that wants things written in a specific way. Overall, the course is made to teach us how to write in busienss terms when it comes to emails, writing memos, creating reports, and presentations, etc. Definitely a hit or a miss class depedning on the professor you got. I think I got better at writing, but I feel like I learned more about the different kinds of emails/reports one can write.",HADM 1650,665
Adam Walden,2,4,4,"I didn't really like Walden. He's a nice guy but he isn't really helpful and you don't really learn in his class. He gave very little feedback on our assignments and we had no idea how to improve, especially for something as subjective as communication.",HADM 1650,665
Christina Homrighouse,5,3,3,"This class made me cry on the first day of school, but it ended up being my favorite class for the semester. It is very straightforward, and as long as you watch the videos and put time into the assignments, you will do well. Go to office hours.",HADM 1740,666
Mark McCarthy,3,4,4,Super picky on the deliverables. Tests are somewhat difficult.,HADM 1740,666
Christina Homrighouse,5,2,4,"WOW. Awesome class. It might be because I am the type that likes the flipped class model, which means that you learn what you need for class BEFORE class begins and you do the assignment during class. I took this during COVID so it was online and we had 1-1.5 days to start and finish the full assignment, but during normal semester, I heard students had to start and finish the assignemnts during class. This class is graded on a curve, so if you want a good grade, make sure to do all assignments and exams well or you will be dragged down.",HADM 1740,666
Andrew Whitmore,4,3,4,"I really enjoyed this class and found that it was the most practical class I took in Hotel during freshman year. I was even recommending my non-Hotelie friends to take HADM 2740. Andrew can be pretty dry but at least he's really clear and easy to follow, and if you fall behind the course packet is very comprehensive. Do your best in this class and it will help you out in other classes like 2010 and 3010, especially during the Excel portions.",HADM 1740,666
Andrew Whitmore,3,4,4,"There were quite a few assignments that we had to turn in each week. The units consisted of Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. The final exam included the Microsoft Office Specialist exam, where we had to study some of the excel basics. Overall, this was a workload heavy, but not too challenging class. We were given the option to start assignments before our lab day, and I would definitely recommend trying to complete most of the project by the night before. The prelim were multiple choice and open book and the weekly lectures related to Management Information Systems. I will definitely use what I learned in this course in the future.",HADM 1740,666

Kate Walsh,5,1,1,"This class is a required 1 credit course for first year hotelies. When it was in person, all students had to dress up in busienss attire each Friday to attend a lecture series from an industry professional. It was about an hour long with food at the end, but during COVID, it was all online with in person being every other week. We still have to dress up, but it is manageable. We have to submit questions for speakers, be dressed up, not be distracted, and submit a paper for the duration of the semester",HADM 1910,668
Elena Belavina,5,2,4,"I love this class because of the flipped class mode. You learn what you need for an assignment before class and then you do the assignment during class. I took this during COVID, so I had about 2-3 days to do each assignment. You get to work in groups and since you work on the assignment during class, class time is basically office hours where you call the TAs or Professor in to ask for help or clarification. I really enjoyed this class as it works with Excel, and it's always great to brush up on your technical skills. Advice is just to follow the videos.",HADM 2010,669
Gary Thompson,5,2,2,"My favorite class in the Hotel School! I really love the flipped classroom structure, though for some people it doesn't work. For someone who hates listening to lectures, quant is a breath of fresh air. The exams can be a little tight on time but have your models ready beforehand.

Pamela Moulton,5,4,4,"Moulton may appear intimidating based on her syllabus, but she is a genuinely enjoyable educator and her teaching style is easy to follow. Her tests reward those that put the work in, and as long as you put a genuine effort you should do fine.",HADM 2220,671
Pamela Moulton,5,3,3,"Moulton was possibly the best professor I've had in the Hotel School! She is tough as she cold calls and will lock the door so don't be late, but she makes the relatively dry subject very interesting and keeps you on your toes. The class is relevant as she brings in readings from Wall Street Journal into class. She can definitely seem tough at first but she kept the class very engaged and the median was A- as people work harder for her class. She's also one of the most qualified professors in the school.",HADM 2220,671
Mary MacAusland,-,3,-,"This was the first accounting class I had ever taken, and I'm glad I took it with Strebel. He's very knowledgeable about accounting, and he constantly brings up real-world examples to facilitate our understanding.",HADM 2230,672
Kyu Ha Cho,5,1,2,I really don't understand how the medians were so low on each of the exams. I think people go into the course expecting it to be effortless so they don't prep for exams (which are SUPER easy!!). Prof Cho is literally one of my favorite professors and is so willing to help you learn. Study for the exams and you will get an A+ and come out of the course with a good fundamental understanding of accounting.,HADM 2230,672
Kyu Ha Cho,3,4,3,"This class introduces  the basics of accounting. The assignments are mainly weekly homework ranging from 5 problems to 16 problems and two mini quizzes of only 5 questions.

Cho is eager to help and responds very quickly to email though.",HADM 2230,672

Paul Strebel,2,3,2,"The homework wasn't too bad, but I think the lectures could be more interesting. The class was too early in the morning so it was hard to pay attention. The prelim format suddenly changed halfway through the semester, so it was hard to adjust. I think the prelims were harder towards the end, but he allowed us to retake :)",HADM 2230,672
Paul Strebel,4,2,2,"Pretty good class for getting an introduction to accounting. Lectures can get a bit dry sometimes but accounting itself is fairly dry. Professor Strebel seems like a nice guy and takes time to answer student questions. Grading consists of 4 prelims, weekly textbook homework, and 10 in class exercises. In class exercises can be annoying if you can't attend lecture for whatever reason because you have to do it on your own instead of with a break out room, but the exercises themselves are usually pretty short and simple.",HADM 2230,672
Paul Strebel,4,2,2,"This class is pretty easy and interesting. Lectures aren't super helpful because they pretty much repeat exactly what the textbook says without adding much insight to the material. Overall, it's an intro class that provides a good intro to accounting, what more can I say?",HADM 2230,672
Paul Strebel,4,2,2,Great class if you are looking to understand the basics of accounting! Professor Strebel is fair and up-front about what material you should know and takes the time to answer questions.,HADM 2230,672
Mary MacAusland,-,3,-,"Professor Strebel is a nice guy and simple professor. He and the TAs provide a lot of help for in class exercises, which is honestly very helpful for most. The homework assignments can be practiced as many times as you want before submitting for the final grade (by the deadline), but the platform we use for the class is pretty easy to use and understand. Honestly just need to study for the exams",HADM 2230,672

Kyu Ha Cho,-,2,-,"This class introduces fundamental accounting principles that will strengthen your understanding of business. The concepts are relatively black and white, which is why I found it pretty easy. There are weekly problem sets that are helpful for exams. The professor listens to students and adapts lectures accordingly if we're struggling on a certain topic.",HADM 2230,672
Linda Canina,-,3,-,"Waste of time my friends. This is a 75 minute class with content that can honestly be covered in 25 minutes. Prof. Carvell is a great and hilarious man, but he spends the other portion of class spewing random stories and monologues, which kind of makes it fun??? The class also has a Canvas course tied to it, with all videos, lectures, and practice quizzes posted. I've decided to just skip class and learn through Canvas. Interestingly, Carvell is in the Canvas videos, so I appreciate his dedication.",HADM 2250,673
Yifei Mao,5,3,3,"If you pay attention in class or do the textbook readings, it's pretty easy to understand. The exams were basically the homework questions. ",HADM 2250,673
Linda Canina,5,1,3,Professor: AJ Edwards. Very easy class. Professor was very knowledgeable in the field and used a lot of references to his experiences in the VC space. Asked him about his time working in VC and as a CEO and he was very receptive and willing to answer questions.,HADM 2250,673
Linda Canina,2,2,2,"I really did not enjoy this class, but not a bad one to take if you're doing the business minor. Everything is multiple choice and not super difficult. Homework is like exams. I just hated how attendance was mandatory.",HADM 2250,673
Yifei Mao,2,5,4,"It is difficult to follow Prof Maos teaching during lecture time. I personally think going into class is a waste of time. That is not to say that the professor is not caring and fluent in what she teaches. Other than that, the homework help with studying for the prelims, so definitely take them seriously.",HADM 2250,673
Yifei Mao,3,5,3,It is  hard for me to retain information during lecture. Mostly learn from completing the homework. 3 prelims and a final with weekly homework.,HADM 2250,673
Pamela Moulton,4,3,3,Professor Moulton is very nice. The exams are pretty easy and the problem sets are fine. For some reason she doesn't tell you what exactly you did wrong on the exams and she assigns excel problems on psets when she doesn't teach us how to use the software.,HADM 2250,673
Linda Canina,-,2,-,"Professor Carvell's class is INCREDIBLE. I am doing the business minor, so this is my first time taking any finance class.

Christopher Gaulke,2,4,4,"This class has a lot of content stuffed into a short period of time, and is relatively fast-paced. The amount of content requires heavy memorization as well. However, the labs included in this course do offer an ability for one to take content learnt in class and utilize it in a practical manner which is most definitely insightful.",HADM 2360,674
Christopher Gaulke,2,4,4,"This class stuffs you with a lot of content and details, making the prelims difficult to study for. The labs are also pretty stressful as the chefs will hurry you into picking the ingredients etc. Even though you get to eat the food in lab, the labs are really draining as you work in the kitchen non-stop for 3 hours.",HADM 2360,674
Christopher Gaulke,2,3,3,"Gaulke is actually a really nice guy if you talk to him IRL but really boring in class, especially if you aren't interested in F&amp;B. Contents of the lecture are super dry and especially rough if you have class at 8:40. Labs are a bit stressful if you aren't comfortable in the kitchen, but you get to eat what you cook which is a treat. Try to switch into an 11:40AM lab if you have an 8AM lab. Also, I recommend taking Restaurant Management soon after you take Culinary so your ServSafe certification is still valid.",HADM 2360,674
Christopher Gaulke,5,4,3,amazing class!,HADM 2360,674
Yiwei Li,4,2,3,"Lectures focused heavily on the marketing for hotel industries. The contents are very conceptual. Final is optional and the two prelims are all multiple choice. At the end of the semester, there's a group project that probably requires a little more work, other than that the class is fairly easy.",HADM 2410,675
Kathryn LaTour,1,3,2,Not very interesting. Lectures are usually very similar to textbook readings and examples studied in class are banal.,HADM 2410,675
Chekitan Dev,3,4,2,"I didn't love this class. Professor Dev is a renowned professor and always cited in journals and publications, but it didn't seem like he cared about teaching and seemed to just show up to deliver the same lecture he gives every year. I do like how he incorporated lots of case studies in his class. No homework but exams are rough as the midterm and final are each worth 50% and each is composed of 100 multiple choice questions, so essentially each question is worth 0.5% of your final grade and the median was a B.",HADM 2430,676
Lisa Chervinsky,3,4,4,"Chervinsky is very approachable and nice, but she is not the best lecturer. This class actually teaches interesting concepts about real estate and hotels, but the lectures are boring and dry. Her prelims are also pretty challenging, too, as they are worded to trick you.",HADM 2550,677
Christina Homrighouse,5,3,3,"This class made me cry on the first day of school, but it ended up being my favorite class for the semester. It is very straightforward, and as long as you watch the videos and put time into the assignments, you will do well. Go to office hours.",HADM 2740,678
Mark McCarthy,3,4,4,Super picky on the deliverables. Tests are somewhat difficult.,HADM 2740,678
Christina Homrighouse,5,2,4,"WOW. Awesome class. It might be because I am the type that likes the flipped class model, which means that you learn what you need for class BEFORE class begins and you do the assignment during class. I took this during COVID so it was online and we had 1-1.5 days to start and finish the full assignment, but during normal semester, I heard students had to start and finish the assignemnts during class. This class is graded on a curve, so if you want a good grade, make sure to do all assignments and exams well or you will be dragged down.",HADM 2740,678
Andrew Whitmore,4,3,4,"I really enjoyed this class and found that it was the most practical class I took in Hotel during freshman year. I was even recommending my non-Hotelie friends to take HADM 2740. Andrew can be pretty dry but at least he's really clear and easy to follow, and if you fall behind the course packet is very comprehensive. Do your best in this class and it will help you out in other classes like 2010 and 3010, especially during the Excel portions.",HADM 2740,678
Andrew Whitmore,3,4,4,"There were quite a few assignments that we had to turn in each week. The units consisted of Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. The final exam included the Microsoft Office Specialist exam, where we had to study some of the excel basics. Overall, this was a workload heavy, but not too challenging class. We were given the option to start assignments before our lab day, and I would definitely recommend trying to complete most of the project by the night before. The prelim were multiple choice and open book and the weekly lectures related to Management Information Systems. I will definitely use what I learned in this course in the future.",HADM 2740,678
Mark McCarthy,3,4,4,"Lots of deliverables and it is very challenging, but it is a very useful class for your career and in everyday life when utilizing Microsoft. Do not wait until last minute to complete assignments!",HADM 2740,678
Tashlin Lakhani,5,3,3,"I really loved this class. I took it with a new professor, so it was her first time teaching. Professor Lakhani teaches with a mixture of lecture and discussion DURING class, which I enjoyed because I learn better by talking and bouncing ideas back and forth. Your final grade is based on 4 assignments weighted equally. 2 prelims, 1 project, and participation. You definitely need to paritciapte +2 times each class or speak in the discussion (took this class during COVID) to receive full participation points for each week. I honestly think I learned a lot about HRM and it made me realzie this is a possible career path for me to take.",HADM 2810,679
John Tracey,3,2,2,"Bruce is quite polarizing, some people really like him and some people really don't. I thought he was fine but he doesn't really teach, just kind of rambles and talks about how he has tenure all the time. MindTap is super easy, you just need to get it done sometime during the semester.",HADM 2810,679

Gary Thompson,3,3,2,"I don't think the flipped classroom structure worked as well for this class as it did for quant. It got a little bit too complicated and no one really knew what was going on. Gary is super nice though and helpful, and the TAs will walk you through the problems.",HADM 3010,680
Vince Slaugh,3,3,3,"Class is flipped. It's easy to overlook the video lecture notes, but don't do it because it'll help you understand the course material more!

Paul Strebel,-,4,-,"Fall 2017 Professor Paul Strebel. Lectures are three hours every week and extremely boring, but you need to go to get Clickr question credit. He allows you to have a 2 page double-sided cheatsheet for each exam (mid-semester exam &amp; final exam). Exams are not hard because of the cheat sheets. Homeworks and the final project are not hard at all as long as you follow the directions and go to office hours if you have questions. The material learned is very practical and the final project (Personal Financial Goal Plan) was very useful.",HADM 3200,681

Lilly Jan,4,4,4,"Difficult class if you aren't into F&amp;B operations but probably the class I learned the most from, and Estb is kind of your capstone project in Hotel. Back of house is much chiller than the front of house because being a server is tough and your mistakes actually have consequences. Taking it on Friday is also more work because the class is smaller so you have to stay later to clean up. Try to choose a management night earlier in the semester when you aren't busy because the weeks leading up to it and afterwards are quite busy, but the rest of the semester is chill. Lecture is a waste of time and just rehashes everything from 2360.",HADM 3350,683
Douglass Miller,4,2,5,"Love the class, but the 3 weeks before your management night and 3 weeks after are super deliverable heavy, so you need to chose your night strategically if you can. The deliverables are not extremely difficult though, and it can be fun if you make it fun.",HADM 3350,683
William Lynn,4,3,2,"This was quite a unique class in my Cornell experience. While lectures can be boring at times, that is only because the subject matter itself can be dry. However, dry subject matter does not mean useless. If you are interested in marketing professionally, take this class. The concepts we discussed are what are really being used by marketers. It prepares you to be a really good evaluator of marketing research as well if you are interested in the corporate world. Might not be a popular class, but there is a lot you can get from it if you are trying to learn. Do not take it if you just want and easy class.",HADM 3430,684
Jeanne Varney,3,1,2,"One of the easiest Hotel core classes but also one of the most boring. Try to pay attention early on so you don't have to take the final and can skip the last few classes.

Jeanne Varney,-,1,-,"Professor is really sweet, but lecture is also really boring. She kind of knows it's boring and allows you to skip class without it affecting your grade. You only need to take 3 out of the 4 tests because you can drop your lowest grade. Very easy to do well if you have the perseverance to actually study the bland material.",HADM 3550,685
Christina McDowell,4,4,5,"Probably the class with the most demanding workload in the Hotel School, though some professors have lower workloads than others.

Grading can be arbitrary and subjective.",HADM 3650,686

Crocker Liu,-,3,-,"Prof. Steiner is an amazing lecturer and is clearly passionate about real estate and education. She really values feedback from students to make sure her lectures and the way she runs the class are suited to what students want. This has happened multiple times and she has accommodated. As far as the class material, she covers a lot but does so clearly, making completely new material relatively easy to grasp. The workload is decent. Every Monday there is a quiz in class for attendance. Every Wednesday, your team must turn in a news discussion. There are team and individual assignments almost every week. She has three prelims, each with only 15 questions, which can make it difficult to score high. She also has a final.

Cheryl Stanley,1,4,1,"I had always thought of wines as a staple course for a Cornell student, so took this course excited to experience that. This class, while definitely a novel experience, is something that I dread every week - the class itself is 2-hours long of extremely specific material with every small obscure detail included in the two exams we have (that everybody I know in the course said felt so impossible even if they paid attention in class) and the little desk chairs in the Statler Auditorium (where the class is held) being very small to fit our 3 wines glasses and the tray they give us. People are always dropping and shattering their glasses and I always feel paranoid about my glasses dropping too. we also can't sit next to friends. Overall, I did not enjoy this course but it was definitely an interesting experience.",HADM 4300,691

Adam Klausner,-,3,-,"The class can be dry, but the professor tries to add some humor, which is great. He really doesn't care that much about the exams and wants you to do well. If you read the cases and (somewhat) attend class, you'll do well on the prelims because you just apply the cases to different situations that should be clear if you understand the cases. There's a significant amount of reading and although the cases can be long and a bit dry, the overall material is interesting.",HADM 4890,694
Brooke Hollis,-,1,-,"The class is more for Brookdale to advertise their branding. The course does not delve into industry challenges, performance.

Grades were based around participation, quizzes, and a final project. The content was interesting overall, but I found it to be more biology-focused than I originally expected. The quizzes were very fair, and you will do well if you watch the lectures and take notes on the readings. I highly suggest starting early on the final project so that you don't have to worry about it during finals week. Discussion content was also fairly interesting and the TAs were engaging.",HD 1150,701

You could review lectures without going to class and do okay, but I would definitely recommend attending lecture because she adds details during lecture that are not in the slides and will ask about them on the prelims.

Anthony Burrow,4,2,1,"Burrow is really good at engaging the class during lecture, and even when things moved online from COVID, he still retained his sense of humor. The material is relevant and interesting as emerging adults ourselves, but would definitely suggest reading the textbook in advance or after the lectures. His exams are straightforward but there were occasional questions based on textbook info that threw students off. Otherwise I would recommend for all students, regardless of major",HD 1170,702
Anthony Burrow,5,2,2,"This class is actually really interesting and the content was very engaging. The lectures were fun to attend since Burrow is pretty funny.

Lecture can feel a little long, but the material is pretty easy to grasp. Prelims weren't cumulative and they were all multiple choice. A small but significant chunk of the grading was a couple 1-page papers about a topic that interested you. Overall a great class and Burrow is one of my favorite professors I've had.",HD 1170,702

Jen Agans,-,3,-,"This class was honestly horrible. Professor Agans was rude and unhelpful, she goes so fast through lecture slides and refused to post them on blackboard because another prof made them? Like can you not just ask him if it's okay to post slides, I'm sure he wouldn't have a problem with it?? She was generally unprepared to answer questions and run the class, she messed up the second prelim by giving half the class a test from a previous year which was on the wrong material. Made ludicrous false statements at least twice during the semester and didn't respond well when she was called out for it. 0/10 would not recommend this class with Agans, heard it's good with the other prof though.",HD 1170,702
Jen Agans,-,2,-,"I had heard great things about this class and its professor, so I decided to take it. However, the new professor Agans is terrible and I'm kinda mad that I took it right after a staffing change. She treats her students like children (""if you can hear me clap once!"") and is generally rude during lectures and when you ask her questions. She doesn't post the slides afterwards and flies through them during lecture, so it's less of a learning experience and more of an exercise in speed-typing. If the other prof returns to the course I would recommend checking it out, but do not take it with Agans.",HD 1170,702
Daniel Casasanto,5,2,3,"I took this class FA20 as an engineer for liberal studies credit, and it was a really fun class during the pandemic.

Daniel Casasanto,4,4,4,Took it this semester. This class initially makes me very confused then it starting to be clear to me now.

Derek Chang,4,2,3,"There was a good amount of reading per week, around 4-5 long essays, but the readings were generally interesting. Each class was either a discussion in breakout rooms and in the main room, or an in class screening. Prof. Chang was very knowledgable and always gave space for students to discuss. I took this class during the surge of anti-Asian sentiment and he changed the curriculum in order to talk more about these current issues. Writing wise, there were bi-weekly discussion posts, and 3 mid-length essays, which weren't bad at all.",AAS 1100,704
Christine Balance,2,3,5,"Homework was tedious and comprehension of the texts were not well evaluated, class lectures were fine but sometimes redundant (especially if you have taken Asian American History).

Derek Chang,4,3,4,The class is a great overview into Asian American history - I learned things I have never learned in my previous classes of American history. Grade is made up of participation and two exams (essays) that asks you to mesh together readings and lecture concepts. Professor Chang is great and is very passionate about what he teaches. Totally suggest going to his office hours if you are passionate about some things in the material. Lectures could be dry from time to time but as long as you engage with the material you will be fine. Readings are quite a lot but try to just skim and get the main idea of them.,AAS 2130,706
Derek Chang,3,2,3,"this class is super interesting &amp; I loved the discussions I had with my group, but Prof Chang ruined it for me. I'm honestly confused why people love him. he's THE most disorganized professor I've ever had and I honestly feel like I didn't even learn anything from him. I learned basically everything from the assigned readings. he's always behind on everything &amp; we only received ONE singular grade the entire semester, which was extremely annoying because I had no idea where I stood in the class. basically no grade transparency - we're left stressing until the last minute because the grade could be anything. the only thing that kiiinnda balances it out is that the material is interesting &amp; the topics are extremely relevant. in addition, it does seem like Prof Chang is really passionate &amp; does enjoy talking with his students outside of class. he's nice but was just ALL over the place.",AAS 2130,706
Derek Chang,5,2,2,"Took it Fall 2019 with Prof Chang - a really great class, the professor is passionate about what he teaches and just wants us to learn rather than making us work for our grade.

The workload consists of either a Wall Street Journal article review or a case study each week, about 1 page single-spaced per assignment. There is also a final project analyzing a publicly traded business and an optional final to help your grade. These assignments are all completed with a partner that you choose early in the semester. Also, where you sit on the first day is where you sit for the semester due to the TA attendance system.",AEM 1200,708

The class is structured very well, where you need to watch demo videos and complete an activity and case due later that week on the same concept. Tuesdays are used as a lecture to go over the material, while Thursdays are OH with TAs. Attendance is not mandatory and lectures don't help you unless you need clarifications. The instructions for assignments are purposefully worded vaguely, but go to OH for help. This is most likely the least amount of work you will have for a class in Dyson.",AEM 2010,710

Cindy Van Es,5,3,3,"Professor Van Es' personality was described perfectly by other reviewers. I had never taken a stats class before so I struggled a little more than those that took AP Stats, but I definitely enjoyed it more than Algebra/Pre-Calc/Calc. The TAs and section were very important in helping me understand the content, but lecture was also very valuable during my learning process. I thought lecture was as entertaining as it could be for a stats class. I definitely could have gotten a better grade if I had a less difficult schedule, but I will say that the first prelim is a breeze and the prelims afterwards are a little trickier. Don't feel that you need to look at the textbook unless you're completely new to stats, attend the sessions where the professor explains how to use the online stats program (it will be necessary for some of the homework), and go the extra mile to memorize how to find things on a graphing calculator because it will save you a lot of time during homework (which can take a little over an hour at times) and tests.",AEM 2100,713

Gradings between TAs are very inconsistent (that is if the TA graded at all). The previous years had curves, but this semester's head TA decided to get rid of the curve. Often, they would give instructions for assignments last minute (when they should have had it ready from the start),  and they still expect quality work, so many people have to pull all-nighters as a result. If your semester in this class curves grades,  it is okay. If not, good luck.",AEM 2200,714
Pedro Perez,3,3,4,"This is a class that I had a love hate relationship with. I loved Professor Perez, but there were a bunch of issues throughout the semester organizational wise (ironic), as well as the class having a pretty high workload. As a fall semester freshman in Dyson, this was the class I took with the highest workload didn't take FWS. However, I will say that I did gain a good amount out of the various papers we had to write and the final project stock analysis. Also, while the assignments themselves may have been difficult in terms of grading, there was an extremely forgiving curve putting almost everyone at A - or A grades, so don't be discouraged by early difficulties.",AEM 2200,714

If you go in expecting to enjoy your time there by taking notes during lecture and leaving as soon as class ends, you'll probably be disappointed. It's an intro class, after all.

Pedro Perez,1,3,5,"There would typically be 2-3 case studies due each week and a module every couple of weeks. To do better on case studies students had to attend TA's OH to clarify the prompts and numerous times the prompt changed the day before the case study was due. The class gave a very general and basic introduction to different fields, so it felt like I did not learn much. The TA's do all the grading, and Perez doesn't even release half of the grades, including the final report. They purposefully grade harsher in the beginning and then ease up towards the end of the semester. The median was a B+ during my semester.

Case studies that are due every week have vague instructions, meaning you have to visit your TA during OH in order to do well.

He structures the class very well, being very clear with what chapters and problems we should look at before class as well as keeping the same structure every week. However, he goes through lectures extremely quickly so it is hard to follow without reading the textbook and/or asking for outside help/going to office hours. Furthermore, since the class is so structured there is little room to fall behind on work in this class.

McKinley's lectures were very good, although it could be boring sometimes still because of the material. Lewis's lectures were recorded from some years ago, and they weren't very necessary for the assignments or exams. The material overall is still interesting, but it can also be very dry. The workload was light and the exams were easy if you put in the time to study since it's just memorization.",AEM 2210,715
James Sinclair,1,1,2,Professor Sinclar is the worst professor I've had as a Business minor.

Marquise Riley,5,3,2,"I took this class a semester early because I was scared of financial accounting. Prof Riley made me fall in love with it! He's truly one of the best professors I've had and he breaks down all of the complicated material really well. The class is pretty straightforward, with all of the tests being in the same exact format as practice problems. Highly recommend!",AEM 2225,717
Marquise Riley,5,3,3,Professor Riley made understanding the material so much easier through OH and reviews sessions before exams. There is one homework and one quiz due every week but going to second lecture and discussion help so much since we go through similar problems. I'd highly recommend this course. Professor Riley is great and will show off his cats sometimes too!,AEM 2225,717
Marquise Riley,5,3,3,"I enjoyed this class so much, and Prof Riley made it very easy to understand the material. You do not need any background knowledge to do well in the course. The first lecture would usually be used to learn the chapter material. The second lecture and discussion are used to walk through problems and exercises. The three exams were open booked. Prof Riley would create his OH based on when students were free and set up additional review sessions outside of class when students asked for them. You will learn a lot from this course.",AEM 2225,717
John McKinley,4,5,3,"Was one of my more challenging classes, but Professor McKinley made learning accounting a lot more enjoyable.",AEM 2225,717
James Sinclair,5,4,2,Sinclair is a fantastic professor. Tests are very hard and questions are multi-faceted requiring critical understanding of the material. Overall very worth taking if you have Sinclair - great guy.,AEM 2225,717
John Little,-,3,-,"Sinclair is the man. Definitely worth it to take a class of his before you graduate. The class itself is very hard and challenges deep understanding of accounting. Yet, you can definitely do well and get an A if you put in the effort. Great class!!! Take it!!",AEM 2225,717
Jawad Addoum,2,4,3,"Professor Jawad Addoum is a good professor for students who are already well versed in finance, but not for an introductory course. Exams were expected to have challenging questions that were not explicitly taught in lecture, the prelims are curved.",AEM 2240,718
Byoung-Hyoun Hwang,5,3,3,Professor is Jawad Addoum. Very engaging professor. Very good introductory finance class. Exams were leaning towards the difficult side since no previous exams were available. Very approachable when you need help or clarifying answers. Homework were p-sets (1-3 per group).,AEM 2240,718
Byoung-Hyoun Hwang,5,1,1,"Professor Hwang is one of the best professors in AEM. He is knowledgeable about finance but also understands that many people are not planning on going deep into the field. Prelims are straightforward, there is no homework, and the stock trading project is fun with great prizes!",AEM 2240,718
Rich Curtis,2,3,3,Professor Curtis is not the best professor but he does teach the material in a straight forward way. He lacks emotion towards his students but you can learn a lot about finance from him. I did not like however that there are no homeworks and we just had exams.,AEM 2241,719
Rich Curtis,3,3,2,"There were few surprises in this class. It's clear the professor has been teaching this class for a long time and he has it down to a system. You won't be required to do much work at all but you should stay focused otherwise the tests could be rough. Don't underestimate it and you should be alright. Covers the necessary financial topics, I believe, so would recommend if it fits your schedule. Heard the hotel version is easier though.",AEM 2241,719
Rich Curtis,2,4,2,The course was solid. Professor Curtis is organized in material prep and is strict about paying attention in class. It was challenging for me to digest everything. Grades are only decided by 3 prelims (1 optional) + 1 final. I wasn't doing great on the exams so I decided to take it for S/U (under the special grading policy in spring 20),AEM 2241,719
Rich Curtis,-,4,-,"AEM 2241 (Fall 2017) (Rich Curtis). I felt like the class was well-organized and he definitely has been doing it for a while. If you memorize everything and read the textbook (plus Malkiel book) you should be fine. He makes the material seem overwhelming and difficult to intimidate you, but if you just doing everything that's required (practice exam problems from the review packet, reading the readings, etc) you'll be fine. That being said, it is a lot of reading so I tried to read the textbook every week instead of last minute cram the tons of reading for the exam. He also makes it seem like lecture is mandatory, but I had one week where I skipped lectures and caught up through reading the textbook and did well on the exam so there's that. That being said, I tried to go to lecture as much as possible b/c I know I would review the missed lecture material at the last minute. Also there are 3 prelims, but you don't have to take the 3rd prelim.",AEM 2241,719
Bradley Rickard,5,2,2,"Very interesting and engaging class if you want to pursue a career in economics in food. Quizzes are all open notes and very easy to get a full score on and at the end, your quizzes can add 1-2 extra points onto your average. The homework can be time consuming, but if you pay attention in class, they should be doable. There's not much to study for the prelims if you go to class, but they are not the easiest thing in the world as the True/False Questions can trip you up easily. Overall, love Professor Rickard and this class!",AEM 2310,720
Bradley Rickard,4,2,2,"Pretty interesting class! Professor Rickard is really friendly and helpful in OH. As a person who isn't a business/econ major, this class was not the easiest but still managed to get some decent grades. The homeworks are pretty easy to get full points. The only thing hard about the prelims is that the True/False questions have specific details that can throw you off, so you have to read each one pretty carefully. There are also in-class quizzes (usually once a week?) but they are open note and you can ask TAs around the room for help so pretty easy to get full points on.",AEM 2310,720
Bradley Rickard,5,1,2,Enjoyable and interesting class! The prof is easy to follow and very helpful in answering questions. Prob an assignment every 2 weeks but they're very easy. Prelims are straightforward and not much material for each prelim so easy to study for.,AEM 2310,720
Kyle Harms,-,3,-,"Professor Kyle is a great lecturer, and you can get most of the information by just going to lecture - readings are not really necessary but can help supplement the lectures. Section was pretty useless. Also had a semester long country project that required some googling, making charts, etc. Exams were reasonable - as long as you went to lecture and took notes, should not be a problem.",AEM 2350,721
Debra Perosio,-,1,-,"worst class I have ever taken at cornell. I've had more thoughtful discussions in my high school PE class. This is some of the most basic marketing concepts you can think of. There aren't prelims, just ""concept papers"", and occasionally you answer some questions about the textbook that you really don't even need the textbook for. students often complain about them because the answers to the questions are always ambiguous. But it's a very easy A and fulfills a business minor requirement if you're into that. Idk how someone rated this class a 0 for difficulty bc that's not an option on my end but that's so accurate please leave it.",AEM 2400,722
Nathan Yang,3,1,1,"Took this class during the fall of 2022. Probably the easiest A to exist at Cornell. Grading was based on a few online quizzes and an online final, neither of which was difficult. Yang is pretty chill, but the content was dry and not very deep. Unless you're specifically into marketing/business, you probably won't find this class too interesting.",AEM 2400,722
Nathan Yang,5,1,1,"Class was easiest I have ever taken, all lectures were already posted in beginning of semester and all quizzes/final exam were from lecture material., ",AEM 2400,722
Nathan Yang,5,1,1,"This class is laughably easy, you can get an A fairly easily without ever going to class. Entire grade is based on biweekly Canvas quizzes that are ""command f able"" from the pdf slides. That said, Prof Yang has really interesting experiences and the few times I went to lecture, I always enjoyed listening to him talk about them and how they apply to what we're learning. Marketing itself isn't that interesting, but Prof Yang made it surprisingly interesting. I would definitely recommend attending lecture if you can for this reason! Even if I didn't lol.",AEM 2400,722
Nathan Yang,4,1,1,"This class is very easy, the material is easy to follow, pretty interesting, and is straight from slides. There are bi-weekly quizzes which are very straight forward, and are no prelims. He is an engaging lecturer, I recommend the class. ",AEM 2400,722
Debra Perosio,3,2,4,"I took this with the new Dyson professor Suzanne Shu. She was very understanding and was an interesting lecturer, but only the pre-recorded lectures were very helpful (in-person was discussion based); people stopped attending in-person or even Zoom lectures. A good percentage of the grading is based on group projects and is very reliant on the people you are randomly paired with. Pretty easy class if you are motivated to pay attention and get through all the workload.",AEM 2400,722
Nathan Yang,4,1,1,Super easy &amp; chill class.  Prof Yang is chill and engaging. Materials are interesting and presented well with PowerPoint slides.  There are no homework assignments other than biweekly quizzes which you can easily find answers from the slides and a final exam.,AEM 2400,722
Nathan Yang,4,1,1,"This class is not too challenging. That said, the material is interesting and applicable for many business fields such as consulting. Your grade is made up entirely of quizzes and 1 final exam. Quizzes are very chill, however, and follow lectures almost perfectly.  Professor seems very passionate and kind.",AEM 2400,722
Nathan Yang,4,1,1,Class has a very light workload. Just one take-home quiz every two weeks with only 10 questions and 2 whole hours of solving time. Prof is very interesting and has quirky interactions with his students! Love listening to his anecdotes and research findings.,AEM 2400,722
Nathan Yang,3,1,1,"This class was super easy. The lectures were very boring, but attendance is not mandatory. Quizzes and exams were very easy and all multiple choice. I learned some, but not a ton in this class. It is very easy to receive an A in this class.",AEM 2400,722
Nathan Yang,4,2,2,"I found Marketing to be a very interesting and easy class.  I had Professor Yang who did a good job with lectures and took all quiz and final exam questions from the class lectures.  The grade was based entirely on six quizzes and a final exam.  As long as you keep up with the material and thoroughly review the lecture notes, you should be able to get an A.",AEM 2400,722
Debra Perosio,4,2,3,"Taking this class Fall 2020 with Nathan Yang. The material is really interesting and Yang is a decent lecturer. Workload is very light, but this might be due to covid. There are biweekly quizzes which are open book and are straight off of powerpoint slides. There is no midterm and only 1 final. Would recommend for the business minor.",AEM 2400,722
Scott Erickson,5,1,1,I took this class in Fall 2019. It covers really interesting content that we see in every day life. There was only a midterm and a final which were all multiple choice. Sometimes the professor would just cancel lectures on Fridays and we would have an online homework assignment instead. Definitely go to lectures because we would watch a lot of videos and there would be very specific questions on the exams relating to them. Overall really easy and interesting class and I highly recommend.,AEM 2400,722
Scott Erickson,3,1,1,"Really Easy, need to go to lecture to pass the exams though since there are questions on in class specific stuff",AEM 2400,722
Debra Perosio,-,1,-,An easy class that doesn't have any exams.,AEM 2400,722
Suzanne Shu,4,2,3,Professor Shu is so sweet and the case studies are pretty interesting. The content is also pretty straightforward. Only downside is the group case write-ups,AEM 2420,723
Suzanne Shu,3,4,3,"Professor Shu is extremely passionate about marketing and makes classes interactive through the chat on zoom. Workload consisted of individual assignments, group case writeups, and group field projects. The 4 highest scored individual assignments count toward your grade which is amazing. There is a midterm and a final for this class which were difficult because professor shu didn't provide much practice.",AEM 2420,723
Scott Erickson,2,3,2,"The content of the class wasn't hard and the workload was fair, but the professor was not very great at teaching. I did not feel engaged or stimulated during his lectures.",AEM 2420,723
Daniel Hooker,5,2,2,Danny is awesome. The only bad thing about the course is the negotiation teams.,AEM 2480,724
Terence Alexander,3,3,3,Professor Terry is a great professor with a sense of humor. His exams are similar to practice so make sure to go to review sessions and pay attention in class. There are two module quizzes due per week + random in class quizzes. Lectures are informative but its basically just the module videos.,AEM 2600,725
Terence Alexander,4,2,1,"Professor Alexander is a really nice guy and very understanding. If you have a problem with something, he'll always try to help. The course itself isn't very difficult if you just watch the lectures. The workload is pretty minimum as well with small weekly video quizzes. However, expect small in class quizzes every week.",AEM 2600,725
David Lennox,2,2,2,Class is extremely boring and was located far off the ag quad. Grades often felt like they were given out at random. Not a hard class though!,AEM 2700,726
David Lennox,4,1,2,"This class is completely dependent on your confidence and comfort as a public speaker. There are a lot of short public speaking assignments with a range of required preparation.

David Lennox,3,2,3,"The class improved my public speaking skills through many presentations, impromptus, and data pitches. I was also taught valuable information on interviews and recruitment. You can always reach out to a TA for feedback on assignments which is super helpful.",AEM 2700,726
David Lennox,4,2,2,"The class taught a lot of valuable skills and information that you will be using. Some examples are creating a resume, preparing for behavioral interviews, and presenting. You are required to participate and talk during class. The TAs are all very helpful and always available to give feedback and help you improve. Compared to other Dyson courses, this class requires less work, but you gain so much more.",AEM 2700,726

Carla Gomes,4,4,3,"Decent class, a little dry but interesting concepts!",AEM 2770,727
Mark Constas,4,2,3,"Online lecture for 3 hours was difficult which can affect your engagement with the class but overall you learn interesting things about poverty and hunger across the world and what's being done about them. Standard workload, short reading reflections and papers.",AEM 2805,728

Denise Ramzy,3,2,3,"The class is not hard but I feel like the content is pretty useless... The professor always asks students to print out assignments and project slides, such a waste of paper.... but overall it's pretty chill just weekly readings, 3 small projects and 1 big project. ",AEM 3110,731
Denise Ramzy,4,2,3,It's a great class that improves creativity and the iterative design thinking process! I absolutely love Denise and her feedback. You also get to work with a real client and affect change on ground-level. Awesome class!,AEM 3110,731
Denise Ramzy,1,2,2,"The class isn't hard and there are no tests (all projects), but she is super disorganized and doesn't tell you what she expects from you.

Dale Grossman,-,4,-,Prof. Klausner is awesome. Grading is unclear. Take it pass/fail.,AEM 3200,733

John Doris,5,3,1,The lectures and readings are interesting if you like psychology. There is little to no homework assigned besides doing the readings (which you can at your own pace). Exams are in class and usually doesn't take long. Tests can be tricky but not insanely difficult.,AEM 3205,734
Aija Leiponen,4,1,2,Pretty interesting class.  The final project is extensive but connects the material well.  Participation is key and a good component of the grade!,AEM 3220,735
Aija Leiponen,-,1,-,This is a pretty good class overall. I haven't really done any of the readings outside of class aside from the case studies and I have been doing fine. Aija covers interesting material at the low price of two hours of time per week.,AEM 3220,735

Aija Leiponen,-,2,-,"The class is very low key, but it's very boring because the professor just lectures for 2 hours. However, the material that we learned is very useful. Exams were not very hard (one was a take home exam). You just need to spit out those ideas/concepts learned from lectures and readings on the exam. Participation in lecture is important for your grade. The final business plan is not hard because Professor Leiponen breaks it down into milestones over the course of the semester.",AEM 3220,735
Eric Lewis,4,2,3,Professor Lewis is a nice and understanding professor. Lectures are a little bit boring but straightforward. Discussion sections are mandatory but extremely helpful in reinforcing material with weekly in-class assignments and quizzes. Prelims are easy once you practice and get an idea of the questions; usually not very different from the practice prelims.,AEM 3230,736
Eric Lewis,4,2,3,"Professor Lewis does a great job of balancing coursework with interesting stories, making every lecture more enjoyable. While weekly homework is tough if you don't pay attention, prelims/finals are fairly expected.",AEM 3230,736
Kevin Kniffin,4,2,2,"This class might be exactly what you need. It is not too difficult yet is also pretty interesting. The class is half lecture and half discussion based with a fairly informal feel. You will have to do reading responses each week on academic papers but that is not too bad. The class will make you quite good at reading and evaluating academic literature. While the topics can feel disjointed at times, this makes for a more engaging class. I must say, the class is very low stress and might be what you need if you are worried about a semester that is too challenging.",AEM 3245,737
Deborah Streeter,5,3,3,"Took with Nick Nickitas and Brad Treat. I think Professor Treat has a better understanding of actual business practice whereas Nick tries to teach with his own practical experience, which 99/100 times will not work for other businesses. I think my view of Nick was tainted by his reviews on Glassdoor, but he is engaging and tries to make class fun. Don't take the class if you do not plan on dedicating a significant amount of time to developing your business. The difference in the quality of final presentations was really surprising and Brad and Nick did not hold back their praise for the better groups. They're the ""men's club"" businessmen type and can be impatient and brutally honest (like your bosses will be when you graduate) so make sure you come to class prepared and execute your assignments and projects to the best of your ability. Overall great class.",AEM 3249,738
Deborah Streeter,3,1,1,"Took with Treat and Nickitas. An extremely easy class with a few user interviews  and business doc writeups, but I feel I didn't learn much.

Deborah Streeter,-,2,-,"Take the class specifically for Professor Gal. (Note: I did NOT take this with Streeter) He is an industry veteran who as sold multiple startups, including one for $120 M to Lifelock.

Mani Sethuraman,5,2,1,There is barely any homework (one due every two weeks) on an online platform. Shouldn't take too much time. Professor Sethuraman is really nice.

Anke Wessels,5,2,3,"I really enjoyed this class- if you're interested in food justice the readings are relevant and they help to build a foundation for the practical aspect of the course.

Arnab Basu,5,2,1,"Great class as an intro to econometrics and international development! I took this class as a technical elective as a CS major, but the class was mostly filled with AEM majors at the time. It was extremely engaging and Prof. Basu is funny and also great at explaining.

Alison Shields,5,2,2,"Professor is actually Suzanne Shu but she's not listed. 2.5 hour class but she's an amazing professor. Content is interesting and she makes each class engaging with some fun/funny examples and videos to watch. Little workload, probably cases every 2 weeks but they require very little work and are graded by effort put into your thoughts. Overall love the class",AEM 3440,742
Alison Shields,4,3,3,"The class is very case study heavy, with relatively straightforward case studies being required for each class. Lecture is broken down into half lecture and half case discussion. Case studies do not have right answers like in some other classes, and instead are not too difficult if you actually put in effort and defend your assertions. One exam at the end of class which can be slightly more difficult if you have not been paying attention. Lots of kids would not go to class before, but they were likely hurt on the test. The professor is very nice and creates engaging discussion. Consumer behavior is a tough topic though but would recommend if it interests you.",AEM 3440,742
Alison Shields,4,2,2,Shields is a great professor who gives relevant examples and explains information in a clear manner. Weekly cases were relatively straightforward. Enjoyable class!,AEM 3440,742

Peter Katzenstein,5,4,5,One of the harder classes I've taken but also one of the most fulfilling and educational. PK is a great professor who truly is an expert in his field.  Get ready to read a whole lot and discuss what you read. Hardest part of the class is the 30 page essay you have to write but if you stay on top of it and utilize your TAs it doesn't turn out to be as hard as you would think it is.,AEM 3547,743
Peter Katzenstein,5,4,5,"Took this class Fall 2019, and it was really great - I loved the participation-based format where it was student led. PK knows his stuff and he knows when to step in and help you but this class is a great way to start thinking independently and critically about a topic rather than just being talked out. Grading was half participation and half a 25-30 page essay (which had very little to do with coursework) but as long as you keep up with the internal deadlines for writing the essay (which TAs give you regular feedback on) I think it's very manageable!",AEM 3547,743

Carla Gomes,1,3,3,"Took this to get rid of a technical elective. I had taken ENGRI 1101 (intro ORIE) and over 50% of the material in this class was covered by that one. The professor (Gomes) was very very slow so I didn't even go to lecture and just watched YouTube videos instead. There are weekly hw assignments that aren't too bad, but they make you read a paper and answer some questions about it each week so it's annoying.

Geoffrey Fisher,5,1,1,"Class teaches many interesting concepts, graded on only midterm (open notes and 1 week unlimited time), and a final project (you can hand it in beforehand to get a check before handing it in for real). lecture is once a week, lab once a week where you give in $40 in the beginning and then play games each lab that decides how much of your money you get back (you can earn or lose some). lecture and lab attendance both not required.",AEM 4140,745

We send in group yearly strategies every week and compete with other groups (companies) on how we're doing in financials, sales, and market shares. Workload is reasonable, and grades are not impacted by how we did in the simulation instead by a lesson-and-learned group presentation in the end.",AEM 4660,754
Deborah Streeter,4,1,1,No work outside of class time. Group work was fun. My professor was Prof. Sauer.,AEM 4660,754
Denise Ramzy,3,2,3,"The class is not hard but I feel like the content is pretty useless... The professor always asks students to print out assignments and project slides, such a waste of paper.... but overall it's pretty chill just weekly readings, 3 small projects and 1 big project. ",AEM 5110,755
Denise Ramzy,4,2,3,It's a great class that improves creativity and the iterative design thinking process! I absolutely love Denise and her feedback. You also get to work with a real client and affect change on ground-level. Awesome class!,AEM 5110,755
Denise Ramzy,1,2,2,"The class isn't hard and there are no tests (all projects), but she is super disorganized and doesn't tell you what she expects from you. She also expects you to have design skills, but its an AEM class so everybody is a bit lost. The material seemed cool at the beginning, but it's all repetitive.",AEM 5110,755
Geoffrey Fisher,5,1,1,"Class teaches many interesting concepts, graded on only midterm (open notes and 1 week unlimited time), and a final project (you can hand it in beforehand to get a check before handing it in for real). lecture is once a week, lab once a week where you give in $40 in the beginning and then play games each lab that decides how much of your money you get back (you can earn or lose some). lecture and lab attendance both not required.",AEM 6140,756
Kevin Kniffin,4,2,2,"This class might be exactly what you need. It is not too difficult yet is also pretty interesting. The class is half lecture and half discussion based with a fairly informal feel. You will have to do reading responses each week on academic papers but that is not too bad. The class will make you quite good at reading and evaluating academic literature. While the topics can feel disjointed at times, this makes for a more engaging class. I must say, the class is very low stress and might be what you need if you are worried about a semester that is too challenging.",AEM 6245,757
Arnab Basu,5,2,1,"Great class as an intro to econometrics and international development! I took this class as a technical elective as a CS major, but the class was mostly filled with AEM majors at the time. It was extremely engaging and Prof. Basu is funny and also great at explaining. The workload was very light, with just a few homeworks a semester, and in person the class was something I always looked forward to. Requires basic Econ and stats knowledge.",AEM 6390,758
Alison Shields,5,2,2,"Professor is actually Suzanne Shu but she's not listed. 2.5 hour class but she's an amazing professor. Content is interesting and she makes each class engaging with some fun/funny examples and videos to watch. Little workload, probably cases every 2 weeks but they require very little work and are graded by effort put into your thoughts. Overall love the class",AEM 6440,759
Alison Shields,4,3,3,"The class is very case study heavy, with relatively straightforward case studies being required for each class. Lecture is broken down into half lecture and half case discussion. Case studies do not have right answers like in some other classes, and instead are not too difficult if you actually put in effort and defend your assertions. One exam at the end of class which can be slightly more difficult if you have not been paying attention. Lots of kids would not go to class before, but they were likely hurt on the test. The professor is very nice and creates engaging discussion. Consumer behavior is a tough topic though but would recommend if it interests you.",AEM 6440,759

Chris Xu,3,5,3,"This should not be a freshman introduction to engineering course. It is cross listed with a AEP 2XXX course for a reason. It is really difficult course for any freshmen who haven't had the opportunity to cover some intro calc and physics courses. I took this my first semester at Cornell years ago, and it made me want to quit engineering (I didn't but you get what I mean). Prof Xu is a chill guy and really nice, but I cannot recommend especially if you come from a less-advantaged high school.",AEP 1100,762

The medians on the midterm and final were both around 50% and the class curves to a B+ so don't stress if you don't know everything. Problem sets are challenging, so definitely go to office hours, we had a great TA so those helped a lot. Overall I'm glad I took the course",AEP 2170,764

Harold Craighead,-,3,-,"Professor Craighead is a wonderful professor, both in being an engaging lecturer and in being understanding if you're having any problems. This class is lecture based with relatively light homeworks.

I still did well though and I recommend this class.",AEP 2520,765
Lois Pollack,5,2,1,"Prof Pollack is genuinely one of the best biophysics professors. She explains all the excepts so articulately and breaks down difficult concepts to really simple ideas. She has very light homeworks but her homeworks and class might be a bit disorganised. Regardless, she is a brilliant professor and the class is very easy in terms of content and comfortability.",AEP 2520,765

Harold Craighead,4,3,2,"I personally am not a huge fan of biology or chemistry, but this class requires very intro knowledge of them. Professor Craighead is also super understanding and kind and will meet with you outside of class if you really do need extra help. Unfortunately, he is retiring after this semester :( Otherwise, it's a pretty chill class- only 6 homework sets and 2 prelims-- no final. The content itself is also pretty interesting and it's been cool learning about other types of engineering applications outside of my CS classes.",AEP 2520,765
Lena Kourkoutis,5,4,4,"Overall really enjoyed the class. A lot of similar material to 1920 and multi, but felt that it was much more understandable this time around and made a lot more sense. Lena is also a great professor who is very helpful with questions and in office hours.",AEP 3200,766

Chris Xu,5,4,2,"Took this with Professor Chris Xu in Spring 2019. Professor Xu was an excellent lecturer and did a very good job of showing us how to think about E/M problems in terms of physics and intuition. Problem sets were not too difficult and Professor Xu likes to throw some unorthodox questions that really make you think. Prelims and final were reasonable, but they were definitely exams you had to prepare well for. Also Professor Xu's office hours are great, definitely go whenever you can.",AEP 3550,768
Chris Xu,-,4,-,"Prof. Chris Xu, SP18. Material is a little dry, but Xu is an excellent (underrated) lecturer. Homework is mostly lots of problems from Griffiths. 3 prelims during lecture time (9am-9:50am), with very low averages.",AEP 3550,768
Chris Xu,-,4,-,"Worst class in AEP. U just got to man up and slog through it. Took it with Chris Xu in Spring 2018. Just a boring class. It goes over basics of e and m again. Only new stuff is method of images and dealing with bound/surface charges/current for dielectric media. Despite taking this class, I still have very little idea of most of these topics. We had three prelims which were all easy. However, the final was quite difficult. My struggles and dislike of this class could be do to lack of effort, so take this as you will. Every other class in AEP is better tho.",AEP 3550,768

Frank Wise,5,3,3,"Took this with Professor Frank Wise in Spring 2019. Flipped classroom was really conducive to my learning, but the class was really held back by any students who didn't put in work to watch videos since worksheets were done in groups. I personally found Frank Wise's teaching to be very good and I learned a lot. Workload 3 because having to watch lecture videos at home was balanced out by shorter psets. Difficulty 3 but could be easier if group work was better.",AEP 3620,769
Frank Wise,-,4,-,"Prof. Frank Wise, SP18. Flipped-classroom style. Material can be conceptually challenging, but Wise always has great intuitive explanations - one of the best teachers I've had.

Georg Hoffstaetter,1,3,5,"An insane amount of work for just 4 credits. Somehow this lab class also has weekly PSets, a prelim, a final, AND a final project. Hoffstaetter blitzes through the material and has by far the worst class logistics and management I've ever had the misfortune to experience. Run for the hills. Take it in spring with Kirkland.",AEP 3630,770
Georg Hoffstaetter,1,5,5,"I wouldn't take this course again if I were held at gunpoint. Holy hell on a stick, every moment of this class was misery. The only organization came from the lab manual, the professor had no idea how to teach this stuff properly and it reflects in how clueless and silent the class was whenever asked a question. Canvas was rarely used, we never were given a grading scheme, the final sucked caterpillar balls, and good lord the lab work. Oh my god. This class is easily 6-8 credits worth of work. Do not touch this course with a 40 foot pole unless you absolutely have to.",AEP 3630,770
Earl Kirkland,5,3,5,"Took this class in Spring 2019 with Professor Kirkland.  One of my favorite classes with super interesting and applicable material. Not too difficult if you're comfortable with pre-reqs (E/M, math).

Professor Kirkland is also really nice and funny and very helpful on labs and homeworks.",AEP 3630,770
Bruce Kusse,4,5,5,"Challenging but extremely interesting content. Kusse is a good lecturer who clearly knows his stuff. Once in a while he will say something outrageously funny. Some of the PSet questions will haunt me forever, but I don't regret taking this class.",AEP 4200,771
Chad Uran,5,2,3,"This class was the first college course that really changed how I thought about the world and my role as an American. The professor didn't use any lecture materials like PowerPoints or notes so you definitely had to pay attention and go to lecture to get the most out of the course. There was also a fair amount of reading but if you went to lecture and discussion they did a good job of summarizing the major concepts of the reading. One midterm, one essay, a few short writing assignments (2) each less than one page, and one final. Highly recommend if you are at all interesting in the subject.",AIIS 1100,772
Paul Nadasdy,4,3,3,This class topic is very interesting and the workload is manageable. Lots of reading to do but there are very few assignments (mostly just 5-page papers).,AIIS 2420,773
Paul Nadasdy,4,2,3,"This is a really interesting course, and Prof. Nadasdy is passionate about the subject. However, there is a lot of weekly reading, and discussion sections are mostly left up to the students - so if nobody reads there's a lot of awkward silence. As a non-anthropology student, having some background in anthropology might have made writing the essays easier, but its definitely not a requirement to do well in this course.",AIIS 2420,773
Jon Parmenter,4,3,3,"I found the class really interesting! Sometimes up to 40 pages of reading before each class, but no",AIIS 2660,774
Noliwe Rooks,4,3,2,"As the other reviewer noted, this class focuses not on historical events but rather the lens through which we understand American history and culture in the United States. The workload is very manageable, though some readings were lengthy. There was heavy emphasis on class discussion in lecture which is probably more effective in an in-person lecture. Discussion section is very useful and I found my TA to be very helpful.",AMST 1101,775
Noliwe Rooks,4,2,2,"This is not an American history class. Instead, very focused on power dynamics and almost more sociological ideas. Big focus on studying marginalized groups and their perspectives. It's pretty easy and the workload is consistent but nice, very manageable. TAs play an important role in this class and the professor's lecture style is very free-flowing which some may like and others may not. Good class if you're interested in inequality in the U.S.",AMST 1101,775
Steven Alvarado,4,3,3,"I took this course remotely in Fall 2020 and enjoyed the class a lot. I definitely think Professor Alvarado could have tried to go a bit deeper into certain topics, but I still learned a lot about America's history of racism through the assigned readings and textbook. The reading reflections were tedious but not unreasonable, and the open-book exams were not difficult if you attended lectures. There were also a lot of guest speakers which was a nice element of the class, though some were more engaging than others.  Overall I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested!",AMST 1104,776
Douglas Kriner,2,1,2,"This class was alright! Lectures were kind of boring and felt very scripted, but that may just have been due to virtual classwork. The class is very heavy on reading  and the tests/problem sets are not too hard.",AMST 1115,777
Suzanne Mettler,4,2,3,"I learned a lot about the basics of American politics, a lot of which I learned from my AP US Government class in high school. I also learned some extra information which is highly centralized on polarization in Congress and the question if American democratic institutions are working in the American society. Professor Mettler is very straightforward, thinks in a very data-based way (which I like), and is very nice (she tries to engage the students in lecture to participate in class). Workload: 2 papers to write, readings, and a few short mini hw news assigments, very manageable.",AMST 1115,777
David Strang,3,3,3,"hard tests, really interesting class though",AMST 1290,778
Judith Peraino,4,2,2,"Fun class that I took during covid, so I didn't have to memorize as much haha. Frederick Nowell is such a helpful TA. he really grades  easily and understands the different level of writing and music each student has, he really helped me on the final essay.  The class is really interesting and I think overall easier than you would expect.",AMST 1312,779
Judith Peraino,5,2,2,Sick class. Couldn't recommend this more--you listen to awesome music during each lecture and Peraino is so amazing. The tests are a lot of memorization but you'll walk away knowing so much music and the cultural backdrop of many songs.,AMST 1312,779
Edward Baptist,1,4,4,"This course is perhaps the most unbalanced and unstructured class I have ever taken at Cornell. Professor Baptist's lectures are lengthy, dry, and rife with irrelevant information and tangents. The weekly readings that are assigned are extremely lengthy and are nearly completely unrelated to the lectures. Furthermore, the exams cover content that is never highlighted in lecture or the readings. There is a serious gap between what is expected of students and what students can actually glean from lecture and the readings. Do not take.",AMST 1540,780
Edward Baptist,3,4,4,"Course involves lots of reading. Professors Baptist and Glickman are pretty chill dudes but sometimes lecture can be pretty dry. Grade was made up of 3 reaction papers (one is dropped and make sure you know what your TA is looking for), 1 long paper, attendance/participation, and 2 prelims. Touched upon some interesting concepts about capitalism but some ideas are redundant. Course is really about connecting key ideas and themes together.",AMST 1540,780

Prof. doesn't say all he's looking for in seemingly straightforward midterm and final exams, which makes the grades he assigns for them baffling. Grading of assignments was harsh + no clear reasoning behind the grading. A lot of reading, especially for a 1000 level history course. Great lecturer, but setup of the course and grading is awful. Too much work for a 1000 level history course. Disappointed.",AMST 1595,782
Russell Rickford,2,4,3,"A lot of reading. Well over 50% of my grade wasn't determined until the last few days of the semester.

Andrew Moisey,4,3,4,The class is super engaging - might be diff now it isn't moisey though - I really liked the content but beware there's a 20 page paper which is kind of difficult to pull together so it's not completely easy,AMST 2000,785
Andrew Moisey,5,4,4,"Definitely not the lightest class that you could take to fulfill requirements (I'm a CS major), but super interesting class. It does a broad survey of a bunch of different topics from philosophy of perception/seeing and important visual and aesthetic developments. For me, it really opened up my mind to different topics, and I wish I took it earlier! I did take it during SP20 though, so the class was definitely made easier towards the second half of the semester.",AMST 2000,785

Andrew Moisey,5,3,3,"Fantastic professor (Moisey), exposes you to a diverse set of readings. Wish the discussion section was more of a discussion rather than a recap of course material, but can understand that given it is an introductory level class.",AMST 2000,785
Andrew Moisey,4,2,2,"This class indeed gave me very interesting insight on how visuals are important to shaping people's perceptions; however, I was a bit distracted whenever the professor walked around the lecture room teaching to engage all of the students in all sides of the room. Sometimes the professor can be confusing, and it was helpful when the TA helped to clarify certain terms during discussion. The professor is really nice, but I guess his teaching style doesn't suit my learning style. I would say the terms get a bit complicated to understand because it can get a bit philosophical and very particular with wording, so it is helpful to clarify terms with the TA. The midterm and final is super straightforward, it's open notes, so as long as you got all the notes with you in class, you will pass, but the exception with the notes is you cannot print lecture slides. There is also one research paper that you get the whole semester to work on, so if you do bad on it, it's on you. The first half of the semester is not as interesting as the 2nd half of the semester, so just a heads up! I would say Professor Moisey is a LOT more interesting in lecturing on a talk he gave on the American",AMST 2000,785
Andrew Moisey,4,2,2,"I took it Spring 2018 with Professor Moisey. The lectures and material were super interesting and there wasn't really  any homework besides the research paper due at the end of the semester which you'll get a great grade on if you start it early/talk to your TA about it. The exams are short-answer questions, as long as you look at the slides/get lecture notes you should do fine on them (they're open-notes!).",AMST 2000,785
Corey Earle,4,1,1,A very interesting course and a light one to take in senior year!

Corey Earle,5,1,1,"Super interesting class. I took it when it was remote and really enjoyed it. There are plenty of extra credit opportunities so you can easily get an A+, or you can pass/fail the class and not even write the final paper.

Corey Earle,5,1,1,"Highly recommend everyone to take this course. Majority of your grade is attendance, the rest is a reading response and a short final paper, with lots of extra credit opportunities.

Anna Haskins,5,2,2,"The course is really interesting and very well structured! Prof. Haskins is one of the best lecturers at Cornell and makes every effort to interact with the class. The sections are mandatory, but very engaging and have good group discussions. The content itself is great and covers important social topics, some things can be surprising to know too! There are a lot of readings, but I just skim through them. We have to write a reflection paper at the end of the unit and have a weekly quiz. No prelims or finals this semester, but we do have to attend two Cornell events (virtual) related to the content and write about them.",AMST 2225,789

Margaret Washington,3,4,4,This class was a very interesting class and I learned so much from this class that I still use to this day.

The exams are difficult but you should do well if you keep up with the readings.,AMST 2512,791
Sunn Wong,4,2,3,This class has super interesting readings but attendance is really important - sometimes she goes around the room (around 40 people?) and asks us each to talk about our insights from that day's readings.,AMST 2620,792
Derek Chang,5,1,2,I recommend everyone to take this class. I learned a lot about Asian American history from this brilliant and friendly professor. Manageable workload and fair grading,AMST 2640,793
Derek Chang,4,2,3,"Professor Chang is a really down-to-earth and approachable professor! If you're interested in the topic, this class is pretty fun but make sure to stop by OH if you have questions about your grades on essays.",AMST 2640,793
Derek Chang,4,3,4,The class is a great overview into Asian American history - I learned things I have never learned in my previous classes of American history. Grade is made up of participation and two exams (essays) that asks you to mesh together readings and lecture concepts. Professor Chang is great and is very passionate about what he teaches. Totally suggest going to his office hours if you are passionate about some things in the material. Lectures could be dry from time to time but as long as you engage with the material you will be fine. Readings are quite a lot but try to just skim and get the main idea of them.,AMST 2640,793
Derek Chang,3,2,3,"this class is super interesting &amp; I loved the discussions I had with my group, but Prof Chang ruined it for me. I'm honestly confused why people love him. he's THE most disorganized professor I've ever had and I honestly feel like I didn't even learn anything from him. I learned basically everything from the assigned readings. he's always behind on everything &amp; we only received ONE singular grade the entire semester, which was extremely annoying because I had no idea where I stood in the class. basically no grade transparency - we're left stressing until the last minute because the grade could be anything. the only thing that kiiinnda balances it out is that the material is interesting &amp; the topics are extremely relevant. in addition, it does seem like Prof Chang is really passionate &amp; does enjoy talking with his students outside of class. he's nice but was just ALL over the place.",AMST 2640,793
Derek Chang,5,2,2,"Took it Fall 2019 with Prof Chang - a really great class, the professor is passionate about what he teaches and just wants us to learn rather than making us work for our grade. Getting an A is pretty easy, just try and engage with the course material (which he makes easy because he really cares)...",AMST 2640,793
Derek Chang,4,1,2,Derek Chang is great! He is a chill professor with a good sense of humor. Class is not too strenuous.,AMST 2640,793
Jon Parmenter,4,3,3,"I found the class really interesting! Sometimes up to 40 pages of reading before each class, but no assignments except one short (1 page) and 1 ""long"" (5 page) paper, both of which were interesting to research. In my opinion the exams were fair (prelim averaged a B or B+). Parmenter's lectures were interesting and he tried to engage the class in discussion often.",AMST 2660,794

John Sipple,-,4,-,"I love this class!! Content is so interesting and Sipple really cares about the topic and the class. Would 100% recommend.

Stephen Vider,3,2,2,"This class was pretty interesting, although I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had a background in art/architecture or history. The professor provides us with weekly readings that really helped me to become more open-minded about how I view history and its presentation.The assignments are also creative and relevant; for example, our final assignment is to propose a historical preservation site.",AMST 2792,796
Peter Katzenstein,5,3,3,"Wonderful class, learned a lot about IR from one of the greats. Participation is a huge (30%) part of the grade and a final paper makes up another (40%) of your grade but in between the large assignments the class isn't too bad",AMST 2817,797
Peter Katzenstein,5,4,4,Amazing class on international relations! Highly recommend. There is a fair amount of reading for this course but it is pretty standard for a Government class. Very rewarding and PK is an incredibly knowledgeable teacher.,AMST 2817,797
Peter Katzenstein,5,4,3,I took this class Fall 2019. I am not a GOV major and took this class out of interest. PK is a great lecturer and the topics addressed are very interesting. He facilitates class discussions and focuses on creating a safe space for minorities and female students to speak. It is defiantly one of the most enjoyable and informative classes I have taken at Cornell.,AMST 2817,797
Peter Katzenstein,5,2,2,"This was one of the most informative and interesting classes I have taken at Cornell.  Professor Katzenstein is truly an expert on the material that he teaches, and is able to convey robust and complex arguments in an interesting way.  I feel like I have walked away from the class with a far more nuanced and in depth understanding of America and the world at large than I had at the beginning of the semester.  The policy memos and final paper can be a bit open ended, but the TA's do a great job of adding some structure to the assignments, and are more than willing to cooperate with you and guide you through the paper.  Definitely take this class if you get the chance!",AMST 2817,797
Ronald Kline,5,4,4,"This is a history class about information technologies that is heavily reading and writing based. Your grade will be primarily based on three main essays. Weekly reading responses are just 10% of your grade, yet it is a good and almost necessary way to force yourself to start reading and taking notes early. The required readings for this class are very dense yet very interesting.  You have to demonstrate excellent understanding of the materials and engage with them critically in order to get above a B+. A very intriguing yet very demanding class.",AMST 2980,798
Ronald Kline,4,3,3,This class only requires about 15-25 pages of reading per week that you have to write a reflection on in addition to 3 essays. Ronald Kline is extremely knowledgeable and you will grow to love him by the end of the class. Some of the content is extremely relevant and interesting. This class takes significant effort to get above a B+ but it is hard to do worse than B-.,AMST 2980,798

Jamila Michener,5,4,4,I took GOVT 3032 online during Fall 2020. Professor Michener modified the course and assignments slightly for COVID-19 and it was really appreciated. I loved her lectures and found the readings and assignments to be really interesting and engaging! Definitely would recommend if you are interested in the policy process.,AMST 3033,799
Jamila Michener,5,3,2,"Loved this class and Professor Michener! She really cares about what she teaches and her own personal research. Super interesting content about the policy process and at the end of the class content, you start with applications to current events and issues. Despite being an upper-level class, I took it my first year (FA '20) and it was quite reasonable in terms of work and content. The final is tough (about 3 response questions, 5 pages each, need to complete in 2-3 days) but should not be a deterrent from the class, especially since there are still few assignments overall.",AMST 3033,799
Jamila Michener,5,4,4,"I took GOVT 3032 online during Fall 2020-- the assignments were modified slightly for COVID which was really appreciated!

Joseph Margulies,3,4,4,Professor Margulies knows his stuff and is very open to student discussion. There can be a lot of reading but he was very kind in adapting to student needs this semester. 3 papers that are not crazy long but graded strictly.,AMST 3121,800
Dawn Chutkow,4,3,3,I enjoyed the class and I think Professor Chutkow does a good job in laying a solid foundation when studying law. The experience would have been a lot better if it was synchronous and in-person.,AMST 3131,801
Dawn Chutkow,4,3,3,Prof Chutkow is super interesting and entertaining in lecture. I have learned so much. The assignments are very doable and related to class content. Readings are a reasonable amount and gone over in class.,AMST 3131,801
Dawn Chutkow,3,4,3,"Professor Chutkow has a sense of humor and she relates well with students. Class is not too bad; sometimes the legal reasoning can get a little convoluted (especially in terms of tort law) so make sure you follow with the readings and lectures. Grade primarily is based on two hypothetical problem sets, in which you are presented with a set of facts and must apply legal reasoning/facts from cases in the readings to your own set of facts. Would suggest you go to office hours for assistance as these are graded pretty harshly. Overall, the class is not impossible but make sure you get help if you need it.",AMST 3131,801
Dawn Chutkow,5,3,3,"Took this class Spring 2019 and absolutely loved it. Learned a lot about a number of different types of legal issues and cases to explain them. Professor Chutkow is a phenomenal teacher who consistently engaged all the students in lecture despite being a large class. Homework consisted of short readings throughout the class, along with 2 ""Problem Sets"" instead of prelims, which were essays you had to write explaining how a given court case should be decided based on lecture material.",AMST 3131,801
Dawn Chutkow,5,2,2,"This class provides an excellent and comprehensive survey of the American legal system, covering 1st Amendment issues, court procedure, civil, criminal, regulatory and administrative law, public benefits, and the Supreme Court. In addition, Prof. Chutkow is honestly the best professor I've had at Cornell -- she's always able to present the material in an engaging and relevant way and makes lecture 100% worth going to. There are two case analysis homework assignments, occasional section meetings that substitute for lectures, and multiple-choice exams. Definitely one of the most rewarding classes I've taken.",AMST 3131,801
Dawn Chutkow,5,3,3,"Took it Spring 2019. Workload isn't too bad, it's two 6 page essays answering 3-4 problems, and a non-cumulative multiple choice final. Professor is very fun and engaging, and presents the material incredibly well. Chutkow is also very friendly and open to help you, and definitely knows what she's talking about. Only con is you have to work on the problem set/essays ahead of time, as around three days before it's due she forbids any more questions to her about them.",AMST 3131,801
Jamila Michener,2,4,5,"I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone. While this class is extremely informative (BUT SOLELY THROUGH THE READINGS) and teaches you about a crucial topic in America today, it is simply not worth it. We basically learn ALL the material by ourselves through readings, sometimes up to 200 pages per night. The readings are ridiculous - the WORST I've ever had for a class &amp; it's as if Professor Michener didn't really care whether or not we had readings for other classes. On top of that, we BARELY discuss the readings in class. Prof. Michener doesn't really lecture - it's more like she preaches in class. Her lectures are hardly informative but I guess they are empowering?? But empowering is hardly enough. The TAs are pretty nice, but honestly don't really care that much.",AMST 3155,802
Jamila Michener,5,3,4,"Professor Michener is one of the best professors on campus. This course is very interesting because we have tons of guest speakers ranging from formerly incarcerated people, to prosecutors and lawyers. While this has some heavy ready workload, it is very worth it. We also touch on sensitive topics of homelessless, trauma, and mental health... all related to the carceral web. I highly recommend this course!",AMST 3155,802
Dawn Chutkow,5,3,3,"Super fascinating class, papers are kind of hard but its beyond interesting. The papers are super fun but sometimes difficult.  A must take for anybody remotely interested in law.",AMST 3281,803
Dawn Chutkow,5,3,3,"Professor is very charismatic and passionate about the material she teaches, and this makes the class much more enjoyable. Material has a slight overlap with her other class, but generally the two classes cover different topics. There were  readings every class, two problem sets and a non-cumulative multiple choice exam. Problem sets were tedious but not terrible, but exam was very tough and made you look at exact wording of question to figure out correct answer. Despite this, would recommend the class to anyone vaguely interested in the Supreme court or Law School.",AMST 3281,803
Louis Hyman,5,3,3,Loved this class! Hyman was a great lecturer and the made the material very interesting. He did a great job of connecting topics and providing a holistic view of the material.,AMST 3870,804
Richard Bensel,5,4,4,"Amazing, highly intelligent professor who is  very accessible and teaches a really interesting class. Discussion-based seminar so participation really matters but he makes this easy by assigning a reasonable amount of reading and guiding the discussion when necessary. Obviously cares about his students and rewards effort. Govt class, but he teaches without bias and encourages students to think critically about the material. The workload was better than most 3000-level class I've taken, which says a lot because this is a 4000-level senior seminar. Assigned about 100 pages of reading a week on a topic that we then spent class discussing. 50% of grade from weekly 1 page reactions to readings + class participation and 50% from a 20-page paper about effectively whatever you want. Median grade for class was an A.",AMST 4021,805

Debbie Cherney,3,3,3,"Debbie is an absolute angel. She's extremely accommodating and really cares for her students. Her lectures can be a little dry but I've definitely sat through worse. The class overall (lab included) isn't too heavy on workload. Rink is a great TA, she's very enthusiastic. Lab HWs were definitely a little unorganized and many were not thought out too well. Prelims aren't too difficult if you dedicate the time to studying. Overall a decent class. ",ANSC 2120,808
Debbie Cherney,3,2,2,"Lectures can frequently go off topic and be hard to follow, but Dr. Cherney  is willing to re-explain material if you're willing to ask. Exam questions are reused from previous years, so it is important to review the practice exams she posts. Most other material can be understood using the online lecture notes. The lab section is the biggest pitfall of the class, as it feels like mostly busy work without a lot of hands on activities, but with a minimal amount of effort, it should be pretty easy to keep up with the pace of the class.",ANSC 2120,808

Lindsay Goodale,5,1,2,"If you're looking for an easy A, this is your class. We met twice a week, with a lecture on meetings and a class discussion, and straight forward quiz on weekly assigned scientific articles. One research paper during the semester and then a final paper. Dr. Goodale made the final paper optional to help students' mental health. It could help your grade but not hurt it. This course is interesting, engaging, and Dr. Goodlae wants everyone to do well and get something out of the class. 10/10 recommend.",ANSC 2300,809
Lindsay Goodale,5,1,2,"Amazing, Interesting,  Easy course. Weekly scientific articles to read, but nothing too tough. Lecture is the first meeting of the week then the second is a class discussion of the article we read and a straight forward quiz on the material from the previous lecture and article. There is a research paper due mid semester and a final paper, however, Dr. Goodale made our final paper optional to help students mental health. The content is interesting and Dr. Goodle wants everyone to learn and get a good grade.",ANSC 2300,809

Jeremy Allen,5,4,4,Dr. Allen does a very good job getting a lot of information in a short period of time but sometimes he moves too quickly.

Joseph McFadden,4,4,2,"The professor has too much content to cover in the course, so towards the end-of-semester he rushed through numerous topics. His slides are usually just figures from numerous papers he read, so it can be hard to figure out what we should get out of each class. There is an individual presentation. Make sure to take notes on each presentation as they are tested on the exams too. He does curve exams and allow for exam corrections to get back some lost points, so that was good. Overall the course content is interesting; he just needs to find a way to better present all the information.",ANSC 4410,815
Magnus Fiskesjo,1,4,4,"I took Trickster Embodiments with Professor Stacey Langwick (She's not listed here). This class was largely art-oriented and I highly recommend against taking it if you're uninterested in art. Professor Langwick seemed to give work in spurts, at some points throughout the semester we had very little, and at others, we were hit with a truck-load. Professor Langwick does seem slightly subjective when grading; basically, if she doesn't like your concepts/ideas you're probably not getting a great grade. The essays are very abstract regarding seemingly meaningless concepts. One of the more annoying things about this FWS is that there is a final project that gets presented during finals week, so be ready for an extra ""final."" I'd avoid this class if possible.",ANTHR 1101,816

The prelim questions are very straightforward and as long as you take good lecture notes you'll be good!

Andrew Willford,1,3,3,"I would not recommend taking this class at all. The professor, although nice, gives very confusing lectures that jump all over the place and cover so many topics that don't even seem to relate to one other. It also doesn't help that he has the tendency to mumble, making half of his lectures completely unintelligible. The readings in this class, like the professor, are confusing and borderline incomprehensible -- and you will have to spend multiple hours on them each week. Ultimately, your grade in this class is entirely dependent on the one TA that leads your discussion section -- since they will do all the grading for your section (even exams). So if you luck out and have a chill TA, this class might be worth considering. Under any other circumstance, I would stay away.",ANTHR 1400,818

Professor Langwick doesn't allow laptops and she makes you print out the reading for every class and it is around 10 pages. It was bad for the environment.

The professor isn't a harsh grader and doesn't put too much emphasis on grades (if you show up to class and show that you care about learning, you will get an A) which is great because it allows students to focus on learning instead of just trying to get 100s on tests and assignments.

The professor cares a lot about the class and improving our reading, writing, listening, speaking skills as well as overall comprehension. The readings are challenging, but he helps make them easier. We get assigned writing assignments most weeks, usually 100-400 words analyzing some text we just read and discussed in class. Most of them aren't given numerical grades and he focuses on giving feedback and correcting our mistakes, which is really helpful and makes the writing process more fun and less pressure.

Sometimes the professor can be confusing, and it was helpful when the TA helped to clarify certain terms during discussion. The professor is really nice, but I guess his teaching style doesn't suit my learning style. I would say the terms get a bit complicated to understand because it can get a bit philosophical and very particular with wording, so it is helpful to clarify terms with the TA. The midterm and final is super straightforward, it's open notes, so as long as you got all the notes with you in class, you will pass, but the exception with the notes is you cannot print lecture slides. There is also one research paper that you get the whole semester to work on, so if you do bad on it, it's on you.

Meeting with her helps if you're stuck because she gives a lot of great ideas. Doesn't give much comment feedback on essays/drafts, so meet with her if you want more detailed feedback. For the final essay there was also a presentation that went with it, but I think it's there for the experience of presenting and isn't graded stringently.

The course content is pretty interesting but sometimes the readings can be long and boring. Don't go into this course thinking it's just about K-pop lol. There's a final presentation (group or solo) and it's pretty low stakes. BTW, she's a bit more strict about following an essay writing structure that she wants so it can get annoying if you're more creative/don't like to follow some cookie cutter outline for ur essays.

The way the class works is that before every class there is some  amount of anime/manga/research articles you need to read. Note that the research papers are quite long but you don't need to really read the whole paper (just enough so you can do the weekly discussion and have substance for papers). Then each class is basically a lecture over that and a discussion. I don't believe participation is part of your grade (though I did take this when covid hit). Also no need to take notes really. In terms or workload, every week you watch a few episodes and then write a paragraph reflection post and respond to others' posts on canvas. In terms of larger assignments.

Prof. doesn't say all he's looking for in seemingly straightforward midterm and final exams, which makes the grades he assigns for them baffling. Grading of assignments was harsh + no clear reasoning behind the grading. A lot of reading, especially for a 1000 level history course. Great lecturer, but setup of the course and grading is awful.

Anthony Cosgrave,5,2,2,"awesome class. Not too much work and super useful for other classes in which you'll have to do research in. I took it with Tony and Tom and they were super easy to reach out to by email and answer any research related questions.

Munther Younes,4,1,1,"This class was a good opportunity to meet other Arabs/people of a similar background. The professor isn't a harsh grader and doesn't put too much emphasis on grades (if you show up to class and show that you care about learning, you will get an A) which is great because it allows students to focus on learning instead of just trying to get 100s on tests and assignments. The workload for this class is pretty fair. There are daily assignments but they don't take too long to complete.",ASRC 2105,884

Phil Nicholson,1,2,2,"I would not recommend this class. The professor is really nice and definitely knows the stuff, but the class is not structured well. Class is definitely not hard but the whole thing was so confusing. I have no idea what is happening. No clear study guide for prelim and final. Things that don't appear on powerpoint could be on exams.  Professor gives two old exams (both of them are before 2010) as ""sample exams"" without giving the answer key.

Most of the time spent on problem sets will be you looking for the equations in your notes. I wish I digitalized my notes to make it easier to find what I was looking for.

However, his grading policy was not very transparent and I was frequently stressed out about my grade in the course. Go to TA office hours for help on the homework.

He's The Chillest Man On This Earth and is always happy to explain stuff whenever he's in his office. There's a few things due here and there, but most of the class is just setting aside time to study. The material itself is difficult (though interesting), since it's a weed-out class, and I cried in the vet school twice over a failed prelim, but you'll survive it.

Most assignments on canvas were not time-consuming at all and were often used as discussion points in the next lecture.

But go over the slides and do the practice prelims and you'll be set. Bruce also tells you what's important on the slides during lecture. Bruce is a great professor, he really cares about what he's teaching and climate change. He really nails home the problem of climate change and encourages students to take action. The final assignment is actually a letter to Congress. Overall great class to easily fulfill the CAS PHYS requirement or if you're interested in Oceanography/climate change",BIOEE 1560,914

Bruce knows his students come from different backgrounds and knows a lot of them takes this class for the science credit. Nevertheless, he tries his best to engage and inspire students.

Robert Turgeon,1,4,4,"It is difficult to do well in this class. I took it during COVID, and although exams were open note, they were  not easy. Questions were short answer, not at all straightforward, and ask you to go beyond restating facts from lectures and readings and actually applying what you have learned. Simply memorizing material will not help - you must understand it. I did end up learning a good amount, but this was much harder than an ""introductory"" class should be. Discussion sections helped to to clarify complex material, and participation is important. The lectures were incredibly boring and did not help much for exams. Textbook readings are very important to do well.",BIOG 1140,920

James Shapleigh,5,4,4,"This class was very interesting in terms of its applications to medicine. It gives a basic understanding of human body systems, as well as some other organisms commonly studied in biology. In terms of exams, it is more important to know how the concepts presented in lecture are applied to new situations, rather than just memorizing the material. The exams are fair and require some written answers in addition to multiple choice. Practice exams are important to do for this class, so you can get a feel for the types of questions asked, and practice with how to apply concepts taught in lecture and the discussions.",BIOG 1440,921

The labs are mainly working with fruit flies and micropipetting/PCR/sequencing type procedures, and since I haven't done this too often, I found the labs not bad at all and sometimes kind of fun. Grading is slightly weird on the assignments since they are so specific in what they want from the free response answers, so even if you go to office hours, you may lose a few points here and there for the assignments. Finally, the class can be kind of repetitive, and when you start getting closer to the mid/end of the course, a lot of the concepts are just things you've already seen.",BIOMG 2801,929

The quiz due dates are assigned, but you will also get some ""free extension pass"" to delay the deadline. (but don't use them up during the beginning of the semester!!!!) For each quiz you will direct your study based on the objectives. I would recommend making a study guide by answering these objectives using visuals. You need to understand the mechanisms and explain them in your own words. Overall this is self-disciplined class and you will enjoy it if you like to take initiative on understanding material and asking questions, rather than listening to professors.",BIOMG 3300,930

The content itself is pretty standard for a biochemistry class, but beware the material drastically increases in difficulty and complexity as the course continues. Metabolism is often cited as the most knowledge-intensive unit but Feigenson's does his best to reduce the amount of info you need to memorize, so expect bigger picture and concept questions as well. His teaching style, however, is not extremely engaging and there is a tendency for him to hand-wave explanations over some hard-to-grasp concepts.

In-class activities were executed with very little organization, much to the anxiety of many students. However, many of them were interesting and required considerable data analysis which was a cool feature. Occasional incidents where Prof. Batt was unfairly harsh about students not understanding directions because directions were given unclearly. Subject material is much more applicable to food science majors so I would not recommend this course to Microbiology concentrations. Big emphasis on group projects. Tests were disproportionately difficult to the rest of the course and relied on 90% regurgitation of lecture material. The difficulty is mostly in that there is a ton of lecture material to digest.",BIOMI 3940,939

The content is still conceptually difficult, but it's pretty interesting and beginner friendly even if you don't have neuroscience background! If you take the four credit version, you get to directly implement concepts about the brain in class with code.

Prof was super nice though and wanted people to end with an A - had 6 short quizzes instead of prelims and a final project. Hw was pushed back a lot because people emailed saying they wanted more time and he just gave it. Hw is also gone over in discussion sections. The content was literally two main fluid mechanics properties that could have been taught in 2 weeks but it's stretched out to a whole semester. Only kinda useful content would be the ANSYS program (basically CAD) we learned the basics of.

Stephen Lee,2,5,5,"Reviews about the time commitment involved in this class are true: between twice-weekly lectures (don't go, watch them on YouTube just look up CHEM2070), discussion/flipped class, peer-led (2 hours), and the post/pre-lecture content, the bare minimum is about 6 hours weekly, not including actual studying if there's things you don't get or need to review. Internal resources (tutoring, undergraduate/lab TA office hours, the support sessions offered by Dr. Lee) are copious &amp; available &amp; I would say the highlight of this course compared to others. However, external resources like Khan Academy etc. won't be helpful as this class has its own contents/methodology, and an AP Chem background is meaningless. A student who has strong study habits, can commit to attending peer-led &amp; flipped class every week, and has a tolerance for Chemistry (i.e. you don't despise it and will be willing to do it for some time) can succeed in this class w/ some effort.

Going to the optional discussion sections and review sessions for Chem 2070 really helped because the grad TAs have helpful worksheets and practice problems that really help you understand the concepts.",CHEM 2070,998
Stephen Lee,2,4,4,"Dr. Lee provided so many resources to succeed in this class - really take advantage of them if you want to do well! I found peer leds to be most similar to the types of problems he would ask on prelims. Office hours were kinda helpful, but could get overcrowded so not all questions will be answered. Lab difficulty really depends on the TA you get, but just follow the example format for lab reports and you should be ok",CHEM 2070,998
Stephen Lee,4,4,4,Took Fall 2019. Great class but a lot of work needs to be put into the class in order to do well! The subject and the material was very interesting!,CHEM 2070,998
Stephen Lee,4,4,4,"I took this fall 2019 with Lee (his first semester teaching it I believe) and then TA'd it fall 2020. It is a difficult course, especially if you didn't take AP chem in high school, but Lee puts in a ton of effort to get students help. Best advice is to go to flipped class and peer-led every week and make use of the support class if you need. The peer-led problems are about exam difficulty. Overall, the class is a lot of work but you can definitely do well if you put the time in.",CHEM 2070,998
Stephen Lee,4,4,5,"This class was definitely a lot of work. You have to be consistently doing practice problems in order to succeed. However, I loved Lee. He is brutally honest but he does care about his students. Also, definitely take the support classes as they do help and you get more individual help.",CHEM 2070,998
Stephen Lee,5,5,3,"There are a lot of components to this class, but in my experience it was all very manageable. I took this class my first semester freshman year; it was a challenge but covered very interesting content, which made it sort of fun. Dr. Lee (&amp; the TAs) put a lot of effort into helping students adjust to this level of work. Peer Led (optional) and Flipped class (mandatory) are extra classes each week that are not listed in student center. The prelims and final were quite difficult - but a large part of that is because they had to be open-note due to COVID-19. I recommend attending office hours, the extra sessions, and taking the supplement course if you can fit it in. This class is overall a great experience!",CHEM 2070,998
Hector Abruna,4,5,3,"I had Dr. Lee who's not listed as an option for professor here. This class is a lot, be prepared. I actually enjoyed the subject matter; it was one of the few classes my first semester that actually felt like a challenge, in a good way. Super interesting stuff and overall Lee is a good lecturer, and makes it interesting to learn. There are extra mandatory classes (Peer Led and Flipped Class) that meet on the weekends which is not mentioned in Student Center when you sign up for the class. The TAs for these courses are mainly sophomores and juniors and were often really rude and not super helpful -- there were some good ones but overall I had a negative experience with them. The prelims/final are difficult for sure, but they're usually pretty heavily curved. You'll get through this class!! I would highly recommend relying on study groups/partners, it makes it a lot better.",CHEM 2070,998
Hector Abruna,3,4,4,"As one of my required courses, I took this class in Fall 2018. The in-class experiments that Prof Abruna showcased were pretty fun, and the material was not too difficult as it overlapped with some highschool chemistry concepts. The problem was that the material was poorly explained in lectures so most people resorted to TAs; the AEW workshops were super helpful in understanding lecture material and I would highly recommend you to enroll in an AEW if chemistry isn't your forte.",CHEM 2070,998
Kyle Lancaster,3,3,3,"The class had a lot of work outside of class including problem sets and office hours that were necessary in order to survive the class. The supplemental class was the most helpful and the problem solving session and office hours were required to get credit points. While there was a lot of work outside of the class, I felt like I learned a lot. Also, Dr. Lee made an effort to know everyone's name in the course which showed his devotion to his students that is rare in large lecture courses.",CHEM 2070,998
Kyle Lancaster,5,4,5,"I actually really enjoyed this class! Lancaster was a really great lecturer. His notes were very clear, and his lectures were engaging. This class is a lot of work- expect to put in the work for those 4 credits. The labs take a few hours to write up, and you'll definitely have to study for the exams. I didn't take AP chemistry in high school, but I was pretty on top of the work and did quite well.

Kyle Lancaster,4,4,4,Loved Lancaster's lectures as they were very interesting. Definitely need to put in a lot of work for a decent grade.

Kyle Lancaster,4,4,4,Took Fall 2018. Taking AP chem definitely helps in the beginning but doesn't make the second half of the course any easier. Lancaster is an entertaining lecturer. Labs are hard and often present material not learned yet in class. Grading for labs heavily depends on how strict your TA is. Prelims are difficult and long; people usually have trouble finishing. Skip questions you aren't sure of and come back to them!! The last page of questions tends to be the easiest imo.,CHEM 2070,998

Melissa Hines,-,3,-,Professor Hines is often condescending. She makes the group quizzes incredibly difficult. Labs can be graded arbitrarily. Don't take if you want a class with not much outside work as there are lots of things which must be completed outside of class.,CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,3,4,4,"Hines is great at explaining simple concepts in lecture. The problem with this class is that lecture is only the foundation for what you're expected to know. Labs and group quizzes can sometimes only feel loosely connected to topics that you talk about in class. Who you're paired with for group quizzes can make or break the class, so don't be afraid to speak up if you're with people who aren't pulling their weight. Prelims are fairly straightforward and usually resemble the practice posted. Expect to put in a lot of time outside of class.",CHEM 2080,999
Robert DiStasio,2,4,4,"Robert DiStasio is a decent lecturer and explains concepts pretty well. Unfortunately, his exams are very difficult and little prep work is offered. The exam questions are often pretty different from the discussion set problems, and definitely unlike the HW problems. One great thing is that the lectures are all recorded and posted on canvas within a day or two, which is very helpful.  Labs are probably the worst part of this class. They are generally very long, and very repetitive. Lab TAs seem a bit out of tune with each other, often giving different advice and different answers to the same questions.   Discussions aren't all that helpful, just a TA going over discussion set problems that are already posted on canvas with answer keys.   The best part about this class is that the final isn't cumulative, it's a third prelim. Professor DiStasio offers ""mini prelims"" during this time slot as well, which are smaller versions of the first two prelims (of your choice) that you can try to get a better grade with.   Compared to 2070, I'd say the workload is slightly less, and the class overall is slightly less intense, but the difficulty is about the same.",CHEM 2080,999
Robert DiStasio,2,4,4,"Professor DiStasio teaches the content well,  and I like how he records all his lectures. However, he's a bit behind schedule a lot of the time, and this makes the labs a bit difficult to grasp (we do an experiment on a concept we barely learned about). We don't get many practice problems for the prelims either. For the lab portion, it is pretty difficult at first because a clear procedure is not given. Also, the TAs would sometimes have different answers for lab questions/procedures, so you need to ask multiple TAs for help.",CHEM 2080,999
Robert DiStasio,2,3,4,"Quite possibly one of the worst classes I've taken here. I believe with Professor DiStasio it was much better than before, as he is quite good at explaining concepts and seems like a nice person overall, but there was barely any practice offered in preparation for the much more difficult exams. The worst part about the class is the labs, as the TAs seem like they do not communicate with each other, and my TA would recommend one procedure but another TA at OH would tell me I approached it completely wrong.",CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,1,5,4,Her teaching was unclear and very hard too read sometimes because it was on a clear board.  Since it was virtual the classes were not recorded.  Also the group quizzes were extremely hard,CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,1,5,4,Hines was a terrible teacher and the group quizzes were so hard.,CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,3,4,4,"I am not a fan of Melissa Hines. She is incredibly unaccommodating, but she can at least explain basic concepts somewhat well. I took the class when we got sent home and her online lab system was horrific. It took so much time, 3 hour labs easily went long and we still had to do lab reports for all of them. Her tests pre-COVID were actually pretty fair, I just disliked her teaching style a lot.",CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,3,4,3,"CHEM 2080 vs CHEM 2070 is subjective but I think CHEM 2080 was a bit better. Hines was okay at explaining concepts, though it was frustrating at times when she would teach material only a day or two before the actual group quiz was due. You have to really know your stuff for the group quizzes, as it can sometimes go beyond what she teaches - would recommend looking through the textbook for support",CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,3,4,4,"I loved the material in this class more than CHEM 2070. Professor Hines is a great lecturer but I think she is not too helpful outside of class. The group quizzes are also a bit annoying. The people are assigned randomly and I got lucky with my group in that we all did equal amounts of the quiz and actually tried. One of my friends was not so lucky, and most of the quiz pressure was on her.",CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,1,5,5,"Where to begin? The professor is condescending, the group quizzes are ridiculously difficult and will take hours out of your week, tests include trick questions and information which was NEVER included in any class material, labs will take hours to prepare for, hours to complete, and hours to write up. DON'T TAKE THIS if you don't have to!",CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,2,4,5,"The class is ok but didn't really like Prof. Hines's teaching style. She's too enthusiastic about active learning and in lecture discussions which work great if you are a group learner but is annoying if you like to get things done by yourself and just silently take notes in lecture. Also, group quizzes were just unnecessarily hard and long and felt like they didn't really help me learn the material. Also the group you are randomly assigned to will determine how well you do on the quizzes which I think is unfair. Labs were also so much longer than in 2070.",CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,4,3,4,"I really enjoyed the class material and Professor Hines' teaching style, but the class structure was not great. Most work was based off of group work, such as the group quizzes. This caused a lot of issues with scheduling, and distribution of workloads, with your grade depending heavily on other people's work. Often, bringing your grade down. Labs were interesting, and I felt, at least with my TA, that they really helped with learning how to write lab reports.",CHEM 2080,999
Melissa Hines,-,4,-,"Hines was a good lecturer who knew how to present the basics of each topic very well. However, her lectures translated very poorly into graded assignments, whether they were group quizzes, lab reports, or prelims. Group quizzes made this class a huge headache--if you were randomly assigned to a group with members who didn't try hard or you had a harsh TA, you were essentially screwed. If you took AP chemistry in high school the class was a lot more straightforward to you, but if not, good luck. It's manageable but frustrating at times.",CHEM 2080,999
John Marohn,1,4,5,"Marohn is a nice guy who's really passionate about chemistry but he's not a great professor. I learned more from the homework problems than I did from any of his lectures. He had technical difficulties every day, so lectures always started late. I know COVID is making things difficult, but every day? Come on, man. I can only think of one lecture that he started and ended on time. Also, since he started lectures late and he has a tendency to ramble, it wasn't uncommon for lectures to last 30 minutes past the official end of class. Also, I stated above that the homework was the most helpful for me but my lord it was awful. There was way too much work assigned and the due dates were all over the place. He even assigned 56 new practice problems just four days before the start of Finals. Not cool :(",CHEM 2090,1000
Andrew Musser,3,3,4,"Prof: Andrew Musser. I got a 4 on the AP Chem exam so this class was not too difficult for me but the labs were really annoying. Do the problem sets (not the same as hw, Psets are just optional assignments on canvas). There is little instruction before the labs and a lot of it is up to the TA to teach you which means you're screwed with a bad TA. Pick a lab period later in the week (but maybe not friday) so you can ask friends who did the lab earlier in the week for help. Also, the lab reports take weeks to grade and we essentially get no feedback on any of them until the middle of the semester.",CHEM 2090,1000
Andrew Musser,2,5,3,"Took this class with Andrew Musser. Overall, the class was quite challenging, especially the exams. I took AP Chem in high school so I think it helped me to prepare a bit for the class since I knew most of the content already, but if I hadn't taken AP, I would have struggled a lot more. The labs are pretty easy and the weekly PSETs are annoying but pretty doable. I think the hardest parts of the class were definitely the exams that were very long and much more difficult than the actual content taught in class.",CHEM 2090,1000
Andrew Musser,3,3,3,I took this class FA21 under Musser.

Peter Wolczanski,1,4,5,"Andrew Musser was my professor for this class. As a lecturer, he was quite awful that you could see less and less people attend lecture each week.

On top of this we have weekly lab homework and prelabs that take another couple hours to do. Overall, the class was awful.",CHEM 2090,1000

Kyle Lancaster,3,3,5,"The tests were more conceptual than I had seen in previous CHEM 2090 tests/experiences (as I had some experience with Marohn's class). The tests were pretty long but the curve typically made up for the length of the exams even if you didn't finish questions/sections even, but the class was in spring so it had a smaller pool of students which have made the curve more favorable. Overall, Lancaster was good and accommodating professor, but he does go fast in class so previewing the material is recommended. The lab portion for remote students was tough without nearly as many resources  as the in-person sources/lacking videos but either way it will take up a decent to long amount of time depending on your experience to do the prelabs, lab notebooks, postlabs, etc. Also, the homeworks can take up a long time, so it is definitely recommended to work on it throughout the week as it can be very difficult to cram the homework in time since it automatically closes.",CHEM 2090,1000

John Marohn,3,2,3,Prof. Marohn was often late to lectures and the class wasn't the most organized. Writing procedures for labs and doing the lab reports was time-consuming and honestly not very helpful. The best thing you can do in this class is to learn from doing the Sapling homework and reading the textbook if you need it. Also taking the AEW helped clear up any topics that weren't explained well during lectures.  The prelims weren't the worst as long as you looked over the past prelims and got a sense of what kinds of questions they like to ask.,CHEM 2090,1000
John Marohn,1,3,4,"Ok. So Marohn is cleraly very passionate about chemistry (specifically explosions xD). He tries to do like a very fundamental-proof based style of teaching however it just ends up in him droning on about the lead up and a bunch of stuff instead of focusing in on the material! I learned very little from lectures and like a previous review said the lectures started a little late and ended a little after time. I would say skip lectures but then you wouldn't know what he was TRYING to teach so might be hard to follow along-but having gone to lectures I still don't really know what he was trying to teach.  Ok so now for the workload. A problem set a week is fair and is good and all, but the problem is if I didnt learn anything from lectures then I have to learn from the HWs which just means I have to spend a lot more time on this hw. The HW is decently set up to teach you material I will admit but you will still need to supplement with a textbook (but the feedback does a pretty fair job of teaching material).

The homework are straight forward enough with reading the textbook, but the prelims are insanity. I can say without a shadow of doubt that multiple questions from the prelim were far beyond the scope of both what was taught during lecture as well as the textbook homework.

As for the course itself, Marohn is a solid lecturer, but occasionally hard to follow - If you do get lost, the textbook is very readable.

H. Davis,4,4,4,"Professor Davis was great: engaging lectures, assigns really manageable homeworks, and curves the class to a B+. However, I came into this class with IB chem credit - not AP - and I felt that I lacked a lot of prerequisite knowledge so had to play catch-up for most of the semester. ",CHEM 2150,1001
H. Davis,4,4,2,"I'm a chemistry major, and I loved this class. The way he taught was pretty great, always enjoyed having this class as my first lecture of the day. If you like Chemistry I'm sure you'll like this class. The 1st test I took was quite difficult, with the average being a 54 (think), but if you study a lot from practice prelims and old prelims you should do fine. Overall, I got the vibe from everyone else in class that this course was kinda hard. He assigns a PSET on CENGAGE that can be banged out in a day, so not much HW from this professor specifically.",CHEM 2150,1001
H. Davis,4,4,4,"Thie curve for this class saved me, was an a- or b+ fall 2020. Lectures and prelims were in person, thought the lecturer was great.

H. Davis,2,4,4,"Expect to put in a lot of work outside of class to understand content for prelims.

Dan Lorey,3,5,5,"I had Professor Davis when I took this class. It is definitely not for anyone other than Chem majors, and even then it's not necessary.

Cynthia Kinsland,2,4,4,"Cynthia is a decent lecturer, she's clear and concise. However, halfway through the semester, she runs out of lecture material and goes beyond lab material which is kind of pointless but not a big deal. Labs are long, they normally take the full 3 hours. The lab reports can be pretty time-consuming as well. Grades (aside from exam grades) always took quite a long time to come out (sometimes a month+ for a lab report grade). The exams were fair but challenging. Shoutout to TA Jacob, he definitely made labs run much smoother than they could have. ",CHEM 2510,1002
Cynthia Kinsland,4,3,3,"Cynthia changed the course by eliminating a few labs and the second lab practical so that it felt more like a two credit course. Labs generally take 2-3 hours to complete, but there are several people who leave early. Both the professor and the TAs were very helpful when I went to office hours for help on the lab reports or problem sets. There were 4 problem sets throughout the semester and they took around 30-40 minutes to complete. Most of the questions could be answered by looking at the lecture notes or Chemistry Libretexts. I felt that performing experiments in Chem 2510 reinforced my understanding of organic chemistry (especially the more complicated reaction mechanisms) in a way that the lectures did not.

Tom Ruttledge,2,4,5,"The key to succeeding in this class is being as meticulous as possible and keeping track of what is actually happening in the lab. This includes writing down and reading through the procedures before each lab section and analyzing the data soon afterwards. This allows you to write more concise lab reports and provides you with time to ask your TAs for clarifications before the reports are actually due. The professor is an okay lecturer but often times, he mixes jokes in with actually important stuff so it might get distracting for some people. Doing the practice exams and understanding the chemical principles behind lab techniques should be enough for the final. Lastly, ask around for upperclassmen who have taken the class before; there are many tips or tricks to doing the lab practical (TAs aren't allowed to directly tell you) that might work for you. But keep in mind that having a solid plan before walking in is your best bet.",CHEM 2510,1002

Tom Ruttledge,-,3,-,"I took this in in Spring 2018 with Ruttledge as the professor, and thoroughly enjoyed the course. It provides a good experimental view of orgo and how it can be applied to the real world (i.e. recycling plastic, pharmaceuticals, etc.). Taking this alongside CHEM 3580 allowed me to better understand what was going on in 3580, as the courses overlap quite a bit. Also, taking this after completing CHEM 3570 (in Fall 2017) was helpful so I had already experienced a whole semester of orgo. Attending office hours frequently about lab reports and lab preparation will allow you to feel prepared going into lab. Meeting with a peer to compare lab notes prior to going into lab will allow you to finish labs quickly and efficiently. Attending lecture is helpful for lab reports, as Ruttledge often gave balanced reactions, mechanisms, and other information that was helpful to include in results and discussion portions. Maintain your lab notebook throughout the semester, as waiting until the notebook check is silly and stressful.",CHEM 2510,1002
Dan Lorey,4,3,3,"Lorey is an absolute sweetheart. I took this class when the pandemic first affected classes, and despite it being a lab class he managed the transition online really well, and structured it in a way that those who try could get high grades.

David Zax,1,3,4,"David Zax makes the course unnecessarily confusing through the use of excessively long handouts that contain absolutely no information of any value. The labs are largely meaningless and the vacuum lines do not work, so it is not even possible to synthesize some of the compounds in a pure state, especially deuterated compounds because everything is full of water vapor.  I would not recommend this miserable experience to anyone.",CHEM 3030,1004
Tristan Lambert,3,4,3,"Professors were Coates and Lambert. Lectures were fast-paced and not in much depth. prelim difficulty was inconsistent because one prof made it too easy, one made it too difficult.

Tristan Lambert,2,5,3,"Let's start with Professor Coates. He taught the first half of the course. His lectures were decent, not too dry. The course content wasn't too difficult, and his prelims were fair and not too challenging. Then came the second half of the course with Professor Lambert. I'm honestly not sure if Lambert is just a terrible lecturer or the content at this point became extremely overwhelming, or both. Either way, once Lambert came in, the course became extremely difficult. His lectures felt a little unorganized, and his prelim was awful (48/100 average). He made up for it with an easier final, however. Both professors do seem to care about their students. I'd definitely recommend reading the textbook and taking notes while doing so, that is my one regret with this course. Taking lecture notes isn't enough to do well for most. Good luck soldiers.

Bruce Ganem,4,4,3,"Took this Fall 2020 with Ganem. The class was asynchronous and had totally prerecorded lectures, so they were sometimes hard to get through as Ganem is a little monotonous and there was no back and forth with students. Ganem is a great professor though, and I enjoyed the class; the material was interesting. It was difficult but it is organic chemistry. Biggest complaint is the grading scheme - 50% of the grade came from weird sapling quizzes that were entirely unproctored. Not sure how it will work in the future but definitely a good class.",CHEM 3570,1005
William Dichtel,-,3,-,"For an organic chemistry class, it was definitely manageable and fair. Dr. Ganem teaches very well in that he's hyper-organized and takes his time explaining difficult concepts. There are also so many resources like TA office hours, LSC office hours, Dr. Ganem's office hours, and CHEM 1057, you never feel TOO hopeless. Practice exams are also really helpful so you know what to expect for the actual exams. Definitely attend lecture, even if isn't mandatory, because his exams follow pretty closely with what he goes over in class.",CHEM 3570,1005
Geoffrey Coates,3,4,3,I took this with Bruce Ganem who made the class very difficult. He did not provide a lot of resources or practice problems and the tests were unfair.

Brett Fors,2,4,3,"Organic chemistry is not my specialty or interest but Fors genuinely tries to make the subject as engaging as he can. Compared to 3570, the 3580 Sapling homeworks are less helpful imo and there were often questions on mechanisms we didn't learn about in lecture.

Tom Ruttledge,-,4,-,"This class is hard, but if you put in the work, you can absolutely succeed. The professor plays a huge role in how much effort you need to put in outside of work. During spring 2018, Ruttledge and Aye split the semester. Ruttledge definitely could use a bit of help maintaining on focus but genuinely cares about the subject matter and his lectures are both entertaining and informational. Ruttledge touches on everything you need to know in class and doesn't leave room for you to question what information you need to know. Spring 2018 was Aye's first semester teaching a large class, and it showed in the expectations Aye had for a large introductory class. Aye expects a lot from students, and although it is possible to succeed, the work required is much greater. My biggest recommendation is to attend office hours and the supplementary class, CHEM 1058, frequently to stay on top of material each week. Falling behind is how it becomes too much.",CHEM 3580,1006
Tom Ruttledge,-,4,-,"In 2017 this class had two different professors that split the course in half. Fors was really great and easy to follow in lecture and his tests were extremely fair. He had a sign-up system for office hours, which made it difficult to meet with him if you did not get to sign up on the doodle poll quickly enough, but I appreciated the one-on-one time he made to meet with his students in such a large intro level class because it seemed like he really cared about his students. However, did not enjoy Ruttledge as a professor. He talked too much, made inappropriate jokes, and had incredibly unfair and difficult prelims and that were not at all an accurate reflection of what he taught in class or how well you knew the material. He doesn't seem like he cares about his students, and having him as a professor changed me entire opinion of this course.",CHEM 3580,1006

Roger Loring,1,5,4,"This class was NOT taught by Roger Loring, it was taught by Greg Ezra, his name just wasn't an option for the professor.  Ezra is a jerk. A girl threw up in her mask during the prelim. He made her stay out in the hallway and finish the exam. Her mask was ruined so he made her hold a paper towel over her face. She said she only came to the prelim because when she emailed the professor before the exam about feeling sick he said she could either take the exam or take the 0.   During his office hours, his responses to questions are ""we went over that in lecture,"" and ""refer back to your lecture notes."" He won't even post his notes or practice problems/prelims to help us. The problem sets don't test the material, they test your ability to use Mathematica. The TAs are sometimes helpful but you get no support from this man.",CHEM 3890,1008
Peter Wolczanski,1,5,4,"Would not recommend to anyone. Save yourself, he just took his graduate level material and changed the course number.

I think the grading for this class was quite fair and emphasized more about presentational and writing skills through journals and 3 oral presentations rather than performance on tests. There are 2 weekly quizzes - one for poems and one for vocabulary - which really help you enhance your knowledge of Chinese culture and characters. I recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn Chinese and has the time to put in work.",CHIN 1109,1013
Yufen Mehta,3,5,5,"I really appreciated the instructor and the material; she has a good grasp on the Chinese-American dilemmas and is a great role model for students. It was a class that made me think a lot and I can't say I didn't learn. However in my experience, there is a problematically large variance in experience within the class itself. Some people were essentially verbally fluent, and others didn't even know mandarin. Overall I found that I was definitely at a disadvantage going in with very little verbal and no written mandarin skills, and found it hard to create a guided way to learn and internalize the language from my nonexistent knowledge base(the exercises and memorization of poems really wasn't enough for me). I would legitimately learn concepts from peers halfway through the year that she just assumed people knew, and to be fair, most people did know those things. From their parents, or from taking Chinese school since grade 5. Seeing the organization of the normal introduction to mandarin made me wish they made it easier for native Chinese students to just take regular Chinese courses rather than shuffling all ethnically Chinese students into",CHIN 1109,1013
Yufen Mehta,5,5,5,"This class was my hardest but also one of my favorite class during my freshman year. Learning Chinese is already hard in itself, but to add on memorizing poems (for the cultural immersion), doing 3 oral presentations for the semester, submitting weekly journal entries, and weekly quizzes on vocabulary, it was honestly a lot. Li Laoshi can be a little intimidating in the beginning because she will fix your grammar as much as she could when you speak during class, but it is for the benefit to learn! She is also the most caring and funny professor, she truly cares about students inside and outside of class, but definitely be ready to work hard for this class. She grades based on your improvement and hard work for the class, but this is not an indication to slack but to truly work hard!

I went in wanting to transfer out to  beginner's Chinese because I only understood about 50$ of what everyone was saying. There's a bit of variation in how fluent everyone in this class - some people were basically fluent and (in my opinion) should've been in the intermediate class, while others were more like me. Professor Liu is super nice and understanding and since it's such a small class, we all get to know each other pretty well.   Workload - Meet 3x a week and we have a textbook that we follow, so every week we focus on a different lesson. Lots of memorization (about 50-70 terms to memorize by Friday - day of the quiz). You're expected to learn the vocab by yourself. Every week is basically like this: Mondays, submit recording of the lesson text before class and come to class ready to talk about the text. Wednesdays, 2-3 people doing their oral presentations &amp; some grammar lessons. Fridays, quiz and go over textbook questions. Overall, if you put in the effort then you'll get at least a B+.",CHIN 1110,1014

Su George,2,4,5,"Decently interesting class, my favorite part were the in class discussions we had about various parts of Chinese culture. Su Laoshi is very knowledgable and passionate about teaching. However, the workload is simply too intense. There's some types of work that are helpful for learning and some times that's just tedious. There's way too much of the latter in this class. For example, we have essays that we write in google docs but then she expects us to handwrite all of that on paper, which usually takes an extra 4-5 hours that we learn absolutely nothing from. Grading sometimes feels arbitrary and as if it's impossible to get above a 93 no matter how well you write. She also has a tendency to pick favorites and it's fairly obvious from how she distributes extra credit points.",CHIN 2209,1018
Su George,4,4,5,"This class was definitely very difficult, especially as someone whose Mandarin was not very strong compared to classmates, but I thought it was really rewarding.

Su George,4,5,5,"I took this class online Fall 2020 through a placement test. Perhaps like any language class, this class took SO much work. I agree with other reviewers that this class took up more time than all of my other classes combined. However, I definitely learned a lot and would argue that's just how it is with language courses. Class structure involves about 1 reading per week, which had 30-80 (usually 30-50) new vocabulary words for me. I took this course at home, so I had my mom read and explain the lessons to me so I could be better prepared before class. I would definitely recommend doing this if you struggle with new readings, such as reviewing with classmates or reaching out for the teacher for advice. You also have to come prepared to new readings with some research about the author, which can be used in each lesson's reading reflection (though she does drop the lower scores for these). Su Laoshi was super nice and encouraging (if you showed up with your best effort) and was very helpful when I was initially trying to figure out what course level I would fit into. It was somewhat frustrating that some of my classmates were literally taking the",CHIN 2209,1018

She has a sense of humor and is generally nice but is not afraid to cold call you for an answer. She spent quite a lot of time with me to go through writing fundamentals in office hours (and totally suggest you go to them) but even then I struggled immensely in the class. The workload is incredibly heavy in terms of delivering the quality she expects but if you truly truly want a challenge, you would probably find the class extremely helpful. The fluency level within the class is all over the place - my only criticism is that she should grade based on individual improvement rather than using an unforgiving, one-size-fit-all grading standard.",CHIN 2209,1018
Su George,4,5,5,"Took this to fulfil my language requirement as a Chinese heritage speaker. I think pretty much everyone will tell you the same thing: this class is so much work. The class is structured as almost a literature class because you analyze 8-9 readings over the course of the semester. Each week, you'll probably have around 8 hours of work. There's an ebook assignment in which you compile all readings and writings done over the course of the semester, and there's also a final presentation that takes a lot of preparation to do well. They definitely hold you to a high standard in terms of your writing/speaking ability. To be fair though, this class REALLY improved my writing ability. Like yes it was a heck of a ton of work, but I think my Chinese writing actually got a lot better. The experience also depends on your own level of Chinese - some of my classmates have really struggled because their Chinese isn't very good. The range of level within a class can be kind of shocking. All in all, this class is super rewarding if you're ready for the challenge, so just know what you're getting yourself into.",CHIN 2209,1018
Su George,3,5,5,"I'm currently taking this course to fulfill my language requirement for A&amp;S. It was completely virtual this semester and well-adjusted to online learning. However, this course is extremely time-consuming. I've done more work for this course in these last three weeks than all of my other classes combined. We learn a new lesson each week and have homework for each day we meet, as well as a written response per week, a semi-final, a final cultural research presentation, and a final cumulative project. The work is definitely valuable and enriching but also super challenging. Most language courses are pretty difficult, but Chinese 2209 seems to be harder than the others.",CHIN 2209,1018
Su George,2,5,4,"One of the most challenging classes I have taken and the workload was greater than all of my other classes combined. The professor means well and wants to see you improve, but may come off as strict. There are high expectations in terms of making your writing ""more formal"" and ""at a higher level"" with little guidance. You are graded on ""improvement"" as well so be sure to go to office hours if you want to receive a good grade.",CHIN 2210,1019
Natasha Binek,3,2,3,"I took this class with Jonathan Warner. Class was pretty boring but he was generous with grading. Lots of reading to do beforehand, but the writing assignments were straight forward and not too difficult.",CLASS 1531,1020
Natasha Binek,3,1,4,"I took this class with Daniel B. Gallagher and it was pretty chill class. If you needed an extension he was more than willing to grant you one. It did get very awkward at times because no one would participate. Also, there was a week (that sadly was also prelim wee) which we had 3 different 6 page essays due with 2 day notices. they were slightly related with each other and graded on completion (like most of his essays). They were also just an exercise to get you to write more but it was incredibly stressful. Especially with such short notice. I do have to warn that if you don't like greek mythology and I mean REAL greek mythology NOT PERCY JACKSON, take this class. If not, it can be really draining. But, I ended up with an A despite writing some trash essays.",CLASS 1531,1020
Michael Fontaine,5,3,3,My favorite class at Cornell. Met the most passionate professor and enthusiastic classmates. Could tell everybody was fascinated with the material.,CLASS 1615,1021
Michael Fontaine,-,3,-,"This class is great. There are some things you should know though. Attendance is mandatory, and he measures your participation. Additionally, your grade is comprised entirely of 2 prelims, 1 final, and your participation (no papers or anything). As long as you do the readings and work hard, you'll be in Introduction to /Acing/ Rome.",CLASS 1615,1021
Alan Nussbaum,2,3,1,"Not as interesting at the course description made it out to be. Professor is great, but I found myself losing focus a lot of the time because the lectures were boring, but maybe linguistics just isn't my thing. As for homework/exams, we only had 3 homeworks and 2 exams throughout the semester, so super light work.",CLASS 1699,1022

Caitlin Barrett,5,2,3,"Great Class, her online teaching method is the best I've experienced. If you put in the work to listen and learn the material you'll do well. She makes the content really interesting. Important that you do the reading and lectures.",CLASS 1702,1023
Verity Platt,3,3,2,"Kinda boring class, I ended up sleeping most of the time. However, really easy to do. I took this for a distribution requirement but I wish I took a more interesting one. Profesor is really nice and has a really cool British accent. They send you messages throughout the lecture to just check attendance through Zoom so that you  are actually paying attention.",CLASS 1704,1024
Vivian Zayas,-,4,-,This class is very boring and pretty difficult for this level. The scores on the exams were low 70s and not curved.,HD 2600,1025
Parnia Haj-Mohamadi,4,3,3,"I really enjoyed this class in terms of its manageable workload and Professor Haj-Mohamadi's lectures, which were very thorough and easy to follow. The material/textbook itself was not the most interesting, and I felt at times that I was learning the basics of psychology and simply memorizing different theories about personality. However, the prelims were not too difficult if you reviewed class lectures beforehand, and the final written assignment was not bad either.",HD 2600,1025
Vivian Zayas,3,3,2,"interesting content but lectures themselves were often boring, difficult to get much information from slides after class so pay attention in lecture, prelims were okay but often included specifics",HD 2600,1025
Vivian Zayas,2,4,4,"The class was badly structured. The lecture slides are often confusing and contain minimal information, ie. a few pictures and words that require the context of being in class to understand. Going to class is often boring and frustrating because the professor lectures too fast and you can't get down all the notes in time. It also feels extremely shallow and not in depth. The exams require you to complete the reading which can be quite a lot, like a chapter per lecture. If you don't do the reading, you don't really follow along with class. Really not worth the time and effort.",HD 2600,1025
Vivian Zayas,4,4,2,"I took this class Fall 2018. Vivian Zayas was an interesting professor and cared for the topic material. The topics covered were insightful, if not somewhat a repetition of other psychology material. That said, the course exams are quite difficult.",HD 2600,1025
Jeffrey Rachlinski,5,3,3,"One of the most interesting classes Ive taken at Cornell. It is essential that you thoroughly do all reading homework because they cold call students in class. This can be stressful at first but is honestly not a huge deal.

Corinna Loeckenhoff,4,2,1,"Had this class at 8 AM (not sure what it is in typical semesters) and so it was sometimes difficult to be present during the lectures, but the content is genuinely interesting.

The workload is rather light and her prelims are straightforward, as long as you stay on top of your notes.",HD 3290,1029
Jane Mendle,5,2,3,"I really enjoyed this class with Prof. Mendle. First of all,  Prof. Mendle is a really nice professor, and I thought her lectures were great. I haven't taken many PSYCH classes, but she reviewed concepts to help catch people up. I thought the class was overall really interesting, and the assignments were fun to complete. I definitely would recommend this class :)",HD 3300,1030
Michael Toglia,5,3,3,"Professor Toglia is incredible, he is quite the character and is very passionate about this subject matter. The class has 4 critiques of research articles (which aren't difficult bc he tells you exactly what you need to do for it) and there was 1 prelim and a term paper and a final. prelims weren't that difficult bc we were allowed to use our notes (bc online class). attendance was mandatory (even with COVID) but he just does a little question and it doesn't matter if you get it right or wrong. I really liked him, there is SONA extra credit options. easy to do well in, wish i could take it again",HD 3330,1031

Cindy Hazan,5,2,1,An easy class that was also very interesting; one of the best classes at Cornell. Tests are graded kinda harshly sometimes for no reason but still worth taking. No workload at all.,HD 3620,1033
Cindy Hazan,5,2,2,Professor Hazan was incredibly accommodating with both personal complications and campus-wide/national/international events that occurred. The course itself was an interesting range of topics that helped me get a better of understanding of relationships in my life as well as my own tendencies. The prelims were online and open book and in depth study guides were provided.,HD 3620,1033
Cindy Hazan,5,2,2,"This is probably my favorite class at Cornell.  I'd also like to warn students who've heard this is an ""easy A"" class - the Hazan does make the material very clear and easy to understand, but, students are expected to still study and understand everything we've learned (use the study guide!!!).",HD 3620,1033
Cindy Hazan,5,1,1,"Great class! Goes through many interesting concepts. Cindy Hazan talks very slowly though and her normal talking speed is 0.5x, and there will probably be no button to change her to 2x speed during in person class. Prelims are very easy and are basically the same as the study guide that she releases. Lectures go through like 2 things each time for a whole 50 mins, since she talks at 0.5x speed that is really like 25 mins, and she also reviews a lot from the lecture before.",HD 3620,1033
Cindy Hazan,5,2,1,"Took this class fully asynchronously because the class size was larger than Zoom capacity. The course content is really interesting and is backed up by cool research.

No homework assignments so the final grade is entirely based on exams.",HD 3620,1033
Cindy Hazan,5,2,1,"I took the class in SP21 when it was fully remote and asynchronous. I love the class and it's not a lot of work as the lectures were never longer than an hour, and Professor Hazan speaks really slowly so you could easily listen to her on 2x speed.

Highly recommended!",HD 3620,1033
Cindy Hazan,4,2,1,"There's hardly any work in this class which is nice because it really allows you to learn and absorb the content. Regardless of major, I'd recommend taking this course just because the material is broadly applicable and interesting.

Harry Segal,3,3,2,"Segal is a really nice guy. He has good stories and his exams are really fair. He does tend to read off the slides a lot which makes lecture not really mandatory, but he's amusing to listen to so I'd recommend it.

You get to see every test and quiz in advance and have nightly homeworks that you can correct before submitting meaning if you put in the work and attend class everyday, you will get an A or A+.

Michael is such an understanding and reasonable professor. There are readings and a discussion post every week but the discussion post is like 4 sentences so they were easy participation points.

Eric Tagliacozzo,4,2,3,"I took the class because the professor's reviews are amazing on Rate My Professors.

Professor Baptist's lectures are lengthy, dry, and rife with irrelevant information and tangents. The weekly readings that are assigned are extremely lengthy and are nearly completely unrelated to the lectures.

There is a serious gap between what is expected of students and what students can actually glean from lecture and the readings. Do not take.",HIST 1540,1046
Edward Baptist,3,4,4,"Course involves lots of reading. Professors Baptist and Glickman are pretty chill dudes but sometimes lecture can be pretty dry. Grade was made up of 3 reaction papers (one is dropped and make sure you know what your TA is looking for), 1 long paper, attendance/participation, and 2 prelims. Touched upon some interesting concepts about capitalism but some ideas are redundant. Course is really about connecting key ideas and themes together.",HIST 1540,1046
Mostafa Minawi,3,4,4,"This class was a bit too much for a 1000 level course, in my opinion. It felt like the professor expected everyone to come in with knowledge about the topic/region, or travel experience. The amount of assigned readings was just unrealistic for students to complete, especially for an introductory course. I'm a history major and have taken a number of upper-level courses since then, and this was still one of the hardest classes I've had. Professor Minawi was a very engaging lecturer though.",HIST 1561,1047

Prof. doesn't say all he's looking for in seemingly straightforward midterm and final exams, which makes the grades he assigns for them baffling. Grading of assignments was harsh + no clear reasoning behind the grading. A lot of reading, especially for a 1000 level history course. Great lecturer, but setup of the course and grading is awful. Too much work for a 1000 level history course. Disappointed.",HIST 1595,1049
Russell Rickford,2,4,3,"A lot of reading. Well over 50% of my grade wasn't determined until the last few days of the semester.

Steven Squyres,5,3,3,"Really good class, took it with Squyres and Tagliacozzo. Really engaging lecturers for both halves of the course, and fascinating material - I'm not much of a history buff but I had a great time. Discussions had a lot of weekly readings to get through.",HIST 1700,1051

Maria Cristina Garcia,5,3,3,"The professor is incredibly knowledgeable and engaging, with such investment in the material. One of the nicest professors I have ever had.

There are plenty of extra credit opportunities so you can easily get an A+, or you can pass/fail the class and not even write the final paper.

I wish we spent more time learning about the background of the religion and filling in the gaps that someone who knows nothing about Islam needs. This class is probably very manageable if you do have a background understanding of Islam. That being said, it's not too difficult of a class (2 midterms, final, and 10 reading responses).",HIST 2530,1058
Judith Byfield,4,2,3,"Really interesting class! The readings were fascinating but pretty dense, so be prepared to spend several hours reading a week. In the (online) course, we always started with a brief discussion of the readings and then lecture. Grading based on reading notes (250 words, bullet points) and take-home essay exams. Overall a very entertaining class if you are interested in learning about African history!",HIST 2542,1059
Barry Strauss,4,2,2,"This is a pretty interesting class. It is taught chronologically, from the Iliad to Alexander and then from the rise of the roman republic to the fall of the roman empire. I wish it examined more about peacetime in these states. Readings are mostly ancient sources as well as some modern books. The professor is really good as well.",HIST 2560,1060
Tj Hinrichs,4,3,3,"I took it spring semester. There were a lot of readings but you could get by without doing all of them. The prof and the assistant grader we super helpful and nice. Could get a little boring sometimes. No prelims, just essays.",HIST 2562,1061
Derek Chang,5,1,2,I recommend everyone to take this class. I learned a lot about Asian American history from this brilliant and friendly professor. Manageable workload and fair grading,HIST 2640,1062
Derek Chang,4,2,3,"Professor Chang is a really down-to-earth and approachable professor! If you're interested in the topic, this class is pretty fun but make sure to stop by OH if you have questions about your grades on essays.",HIST 2640,1062
Derek Chang,4,3,4,The class is a great overview into Asian American history - I learned things I have never learned in my previous classes of American history. Grade is made up of participation and two exams (essays) that asks you to mesh together readings and lecture concepts. Professor Chang is great and is very passionate about what he teaches. Totally suggest going to his office hours if you are passionate about some things in the material. Lectures could be dry from time to time but as long as you engage with the material you will be fine. Readings are quite a lot but try to just skim and get the main idea of them.,HIST 2640,1062
Derek Chang,3,2,3,"this class is super interesting &amp; I loved the discussions I had with my group, but Prof Chang ruined it for me. I'm honestly confused why people love him. he's THE most disorganized professor I've ever had and I honestly feel like I didn't even learn anything from him. I learned basically everything from the assigned readings. he's always behind on everything &amp; we only received ONE singular grade the entire semester, which was extremely annoying because I had no idea where I stood in the class. basically no grade transparency - we're left stressing until the last minute because the grade could be anything. the only thing that kiiinnda balances it out is that the material is interesting &amp; the topics are extremely relevant. in addition, it does seem like Prof Chang is really passionate &amp; does enjoy talking with his students outside of class. he's nice but was just ALL over the place.",HIST 2640,1062
Derek Chang,5,2,2,"Took it Fall 2019 with Prof Chang - a really great class, the professor is passionate about what he teaches and just wants us to learn rather than making us work for our grade. Getting an A is pretty easy, just try and engage with the course material (which he makes easy because he really cares)...",HIST 2640,1062
Derek Chang,4,1,2,Derek Chang is great! He is a chill professor with a good sense of humor. Class is not too strenuous.,HIST 2640,1062
Nathan Pilkington,-,3,-,"Interesting lectures that aren't mandatory, and he posts the lecture slides, but if you aren't in class you will miss tons of important information. Good bit of reading for homework but easy enough to skim. Only 2 prelims and 2 essays, no final. If you go to discussion one day a week, you only have to write 1 essay. Interesting class, and Strauss is a decent lecturer.",HIST 2650,1063
Jon Parmenter,4,3,3,"I found the class really interesting! Sometimes up to 40 pages of reading before each class, but no assignments except one short (1 page) and 1 ""long"" (5 page) paper, both of which were interesting to research. In my opinion the exams were fair (prelim averaged a B or B+). Parmenter's lectures were interesting and he tried to engage the class in discussion often.",HIST 2660,1064
Eric Rebillard,4,2,3,"Overall, this class was a decent experience. The lectures were a bit dry and it was difficult to remember all of the information, but it was interesting to learn more about the historical figures that I had heard about in high school. The instructors were very fair. Would recommend to people interested in the subject.",HIST 2689,1065
Suman Seth,2,2,5,"Avoid this class at all costs if you are taking it to satisfy a distribution requirement. More than a 100 pages of assigned readings per week, and weekly 800-1000 word essays. Plus, these essays are expected to be ""graduate student"" level work to get anything higher than a B. Professor Seth, however, is absolutely amazing and very enthusiastic in teaching the material.",HIST 2710,1066
Stephen Vider,3,2,2,"This class was pretty interesting, although I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had a background in art/architecture or history. The professor provides us with weekly readings that really helped me to become more open-minded about how I view history and its presentation.The assignments are also creative and relevant; for example, our final assignment is to propose a historical preservation site.",HIST 2792,1067
Paul Friedland,5,4,3,"Really entertaining lectures and the professor is great. The essays are definitely research intensive and you really need to pay attention and go to class. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this course.",HIST 2860,1068
Sara Pritchard,3,3,3,"STSI 2381: This class gave a history of different technologies and their effect on social, cultural, and economic issues at that time. The material was interesting and very unique, and there were frequent class discussions to make the class more interactive. There was quite a bit of reading and writing, but the workload was not bad.",HIST 2881,1069
Ronald Kline,5,4,4,"This is a history class about information technologies that is heavily reading and writing based. Your grade will be primarily based on three main essays. Weekly reading responses are just 10% of your grade, yet it is a good and almost necessary way to force yourself to start reading and taking notes early. The required readings for this class are very dense yet very interesting.  You have to demonstrate excellent understanding of the materials and engage with them critically in order to get above a B+. A very intriguing yet very demanding class.",HIST 2920,1070
Ronald Kline,4,3,3,This class only requires about 15-25 pages of reading per week that you have to write a reflection on in addition to 3 essays. Ronald Kline is extremely knowledgeable and you will grow to love him by the end of the class. Some of the content is extremely relevant and interesting. This class takes significant effort to get above a B+ but it is hard to do worse than B-.,HIST 2920,1070
Ronald Kline,-,4,-,"Lots of reading and writing, but very interesting content. Kline can sometimes drone on a little, however the structure is unique and interesting for a course of its kind.",HIST 2920,1070
Iago Gocheleishvili,5,2,2,Best class ever taken at Cornell so far,HIST 3519,1071
Iago Gocheleishvili,2,3,3,"Overall, not a very difficult class, but very tedious unless you're super passionate about the topics. There were about 3 large essays and 1 final research paper which constitutes the grade. Films and readings were tedious, but interesting. Would probably not take again but do not regret it either.",HIST 3519,1071
Iago Gocheleishvili,4,3,4,The more dry facts lectures can be rather dull. But the professor's comfortable and anecdotal style makes things interesting. Learned a great deal and also watched some good films.,HIST 3519,1071
Louis Hyman,5,3,3,Loved this class! Hyman was a great lecturer and the made the material very interesting. He did a great job of connecting topics and providing a holistic view of the material.,HIST 3870,1072
Tamara Loos,5,3,4,Be prepared to read - it's crosslisted with a 6000-level class for a reason.  But definitely useful for learning more about the region from the 1800s onwards!,HIST 3960,1073
Rachel Weil,5,4,4,"I loved this course. Probably one of the best I've ever taken at Cornell. Professor Weil is great, really knows what she's talking about, and is more than willing to go above and beyond to help students if you show interest. You'll get lots of great feedback on your writing (she is not the easiest grader, but I improved a lot throughout the course of the semester). Be prepared for a lot of reading, but know it'll pay off. Highly recommend this class!",HIST 4945,1074

Linda Gasser,5,2,5,This professor was very interesting and kind. She took the time to review all of my work and the work she gave us was very insightful.,ILRHR 3620,1078
Peter Katzenstein,5,4,5,One of the harder classes I've taken but also one of the most fulfilling and educational. PK is a great professor who truly is an expert in his field.  Get ready to read a whole lot and discuss what you read. Hardest part of the class is the 30 page essay you have to write but if you stay on top of it and utilize your TAs it doesn't turn out to be as hard as you would think it is.,ILRIC 3547,1079
Peter Katzenstein,5,4,5,"Took this class Fall 2019, and it was really great - I loved the participation-based format where it was student led. PK knows his stuff and he knows when to step in and help you but this class is a great way to start thinking independently and critically about a topic rather than just being talked out. Grading was half participation and half a 25-30 page essay (which had very little to do with coursework) but as long as you keep up with the internal deadlines for writing the essay (which TAs give you regular feedback on) I think it's very manageable!",ILRIC 3547,1079
Peter Katzenstein,5,5,5,"This is an incredible course, with the most knowlegable and supportive TAs and professor you will ever find. The course is challenging but rewarding, and you will walk away with tons of take aways.",ILRIC 3547,1079
M. Diane Burton,3,3,3,"The professor is so sweet and passionate about the course. It is a good amount of reading and assignments, but it is overall a well structured and engaging class.it is a great class to use as a business management requirement fulfillment.",ILRID 1700,1080

M. Diane Burton,3,2,2,"I would recommend this class. Professor Burton is engaging and likes to get participation from everyone in this large lecture. Class discusses the history of business for the first half and after the prelim covers modern business management strategy. The final is not cumulative. Workload is light, as there are only a few short group papers.",ILRID 1700,1080
Christina Homrighouse,4,2,1,This class is actually really useful if you don't know anything about excel. I came into this class without knowing much. Prof is really nice and helpful. The class assignments are just following her screen. I enjoy this class and would recommend others to take it to learn this skill.,ILRID 2660,1081
Stephanie Thomas,4,4,4,One of the best professors I have ever had. She was very kind and was always available to review information. She also responded very quickly over email.,ILRLE 2400,1082
Robert Hutchens,3,3,2,"Hutchens' class was predominantly based on 3 prelims, 2 econ problem sets, and 2 quizzes. Class lectures simply reflected reading materials. Make sure you do the readings but lectures do not seem to be necessary. Sometimes topics get confusing though, so try to keep up as much as possible. Concepts are very conceptual and do not really require mathematics except for calculating the future value of specialized education investment. Hutchens is a nice guy, he always is a proponent of explaining one more time for those who may still be confused...no questions asked. The material could be a bit dry.",ILRLE 2400,1082
Stephanie Thomas,3,3,4,"Not super interesting and not super hard, a meh class if you are not very into labor econ. Problem sets are time consuming but not that difficult, cram before the midterm and final and you will probably be okay",ILRLE 2400,1082
Francine Blau,3,4,3,Professor Blau knows her stuff - she is one of the leading academics in terms of female labor and economics. Course material is very economics-technical and conceptual though Blau does try to include real-world applications and examples. Make sure you are very very thorough in the open-book exam (my semester was impacted by COVID) and that all relevant details are included. I remember a lot of kids in my class got points taken off here and there because they omitted something. Lecture can be really dry and it's easy to tune out but as long as you do the readings you should be fine. Group project was not fun if you were assigned bad group members.,ILRLE 4450,1083
Francine Blau,-,3,-,"I thought this class would be for social justice warriors but it really does open your eyes to differences in opportunity of different racial and gender groups. Most of what you need is in class, but the book is a good supplement. You do not have to be an economics wiz to do well in this class. Pay attention in class, even if it can get a bit dull at times. Blau is not the most exciting professor but she is kind hearted.",ILRLE 4450,1083
Michelle Chen,3,3,3,Well well well. Michelle Chen. MT Snyder. Interesting course. Love the topics. Not so much the format of the class. Totally all over the place. Essays were all bull.

Ileen Devault,4,3,3,"I really enjoyed this class! Lectures were super interesting and TA and prof are very engaging.

Multiple extra credit opportunities!",ILRLR 1100,1084
Jason Newton,4,2,1,"This class was great and I highly recommend taking it even if not in ILR and its required. The class is fairly easy, despite having a lot of reading assigned.

Michael Gold,3,5,5,"To do well in this class, you will have to work in groups frequently and for long periods of time. If you're someone who makes a habit of skipping class, you will probably fail Gold's class. This class rests on your ability to apply all the concepts to the cases, so reading is 100% necessary 100% of the time. The curve for this class is massive, so in the end, it'll all work out.",ILRLR 2010,1085
Kate Griffith,5,4,3,"Professor Griffith is a great professor and she keeps things organized and regimented. She will go through each case every class and will hold your hand through it, so you will get the significance of each case. While she will not call on you in class, you should still try to read through the cases so you know what the fact patterns are and the specifics. Just really be prepared on the day that you are expected to give the details of the case. She will also teach you how to read cases and how to do legal research. I thoroughly enjoyed the course material. Grades were determined based on 2 exams and a legal research paper. For the exams, time management is KEY (cannot stress this enough) - make sure you get straight to the legal point, the case facts as they apply to your case, and the legal reasoning.",ILRLR 2010,1085
Michael Gold,2,5,5,This is by far the most STRESSFUL CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT CORNELL! Make sure to do all the readings for the daily quizzes and exams because you can get NEGATIVE exam scores and Gold is one of the most unhelpful people. You don't really have to pay attention to lecture unless you want to pursue this type of law. Also make sure to pay attention when reviewing LexisNexis because that is a huge part of the final that you CAN'T GET AN 100 ON (for real). I ended up with a B+ but the experience was one of the worst. The only redeeming quality about the course was that Gold teaches you how to operate in an incredibly stressful workplace and how to prioritize certain things.,ILRLR 2010,1085
Michael Gold,3,5,5,"Extremely difficult with Gold. DO THE READINGS and you may have a shot. No exams, just papers, but they are extremely time consuming and the directions are unclear (even the TAs do not understand what is going on). Interesting at times if you are into law, but not worth the traumatizing experience",ILRLR 2010,1085
Michael Gold,4,4,5,"If you take it with Gold, you will put in more work and effort, but I thought it was worth it. Gold's class is more focused on reasoning and analytical skills and you will spend a good deal of time learning about syllogisms, deductive and inductive reasoning, analogies, etc. He is strict about ridiculous things, but is also quite knowledgeable. I found his lectures interesting, but some might find them a bit dry. Most assignments will involve applying concepts to cases. The pop quizzes are based on the readings and are hit or miss, but usually if you've done the readings they are manageable. Instead of exams, there is a research assignment, which is tricky but teaches you a lot about legal research. Grades are low, but the class is curved heavily so final grades are comparable to other 2010 classes. Overall, if you have an interest in law, I'd strongly recommend taking it with Gold.",ILRLR 2010,1085
Kate Griffith,-,4,-,Put in more work in this class than any other one. But the class was not impossible. You will have long nights of arguing with your buddies about the cases but it really makes you get closer with your team as you all try to fight for the same goal.,ILRLR 2010,1085
Duanyi Yang,4,2,3,"Make sure to pay attention to her lectures! Duanyi is incredibly understanding and wants all of her students to succeed. The collective bargaining exercise can get really confusing, so make sure to ask questions before you and your partners begin. The prelims are moderately difficult and the readings can get insanely long, but it definitely is a manageable class!",ILRLR 2050,1086
Adam Seth Litwin,3,2,3,"This class is unorganized and dry. The content might be interesting depending on how much you like learning about unions, but lecture is always a drag. There are only 3 graded assignments (midterm, simulation, final) so you should probably study pretty hard for the midterm and final if you want to do well in the class",ILRLR 2050,1086
Allison Heinemann,4,4,4,"Professor Weiner Heinemann is an amazing professor - she has helped me go from not knowing anything about disability rights to really appreciating them. She is really knowledgeable about the material, is very thorough and articulate, and will give you personalized attention to personal needs and your writing. Class is a lot of work but it is very, very much worth it. Make sure you come to each class having at the bare minimum skimmed the readings. Grade is made up of participation, a debates paper, a research paper + presentation. Course material was interesting, especially in terms of watching video testimonies of disability advocates. Would totally recommend this class and keeping a personal connection with the professor.",ILRLR 2060,1087
Samuel Nelson,2,2,2,"The course is disorganized. Canvas was rarely updated, students were not informed of what chapters the reading quizzes would be on.

James Gross,2,2,2,Not much work throughout the semester but the class is heavily participation-based (40% of grade).

Matthew Saleh,2,2,2,This class is kind of boring but none the less the content is cool. I enjoy reading the case briefs and the short time in class we spend reviewing them.

There are a lot of readings, but I just skim through them. We have to write a reflection paper at the end of the unit and have a weekly quiz. No prelims or finals this semester, but we do have to attend two Cornell events (virtual) related to the content and write about them.",ILROB 2220,1093

Anna Haskins,-,2,-,Pretty easy if you go to class and do the readings (they're kind of a lot but really helpful). Section is mandatory but pretty interesting. You have to write a one page (double-spaced) memo each week about the readings and theres 2 in class prelims and one take home final. Professor Haskins is super nice and there are a ton of opportunities for extra credit. It's also a part of the inequality studies minor.,ILROB 2220,1093

Edward Baptist,1,4,4,"This course is perhaps the most unbalanced and unstructured class I have ever taken at Cornell. Professor Baptist's lectures are lengthy, dry, and rife with irrelevant information and tangents. The weekly readings that are assigned are extremely lengthy and are nearly completely unrelated to the lectures. Furthermore, the exams cover content that is never highlighted in lecture or the readings. There is a serious gap between what is expected of students and what students can actually glean from lecture and the readings. Do not take.",ILRLR 1845,1097
Edward Baptist,3,4,4,"Course involves lots of reading. Professors Baptist and Glickman are pretty chill dudes but sometimes lecture can be pretty dry. Grade was made up of 3 reaction papers (one is dropped and make sure you know what your TA is looking for), 1 long paper, attendance/participation, and 2 prelims. Touched upon some interesting concepts about capitalism but some ideas are redundant. Course is really about connecting key ideas and themes together.",ILRLR 1845,1097

Kevin Packard,2,3,3,"Cross-listed with ILRST 2100. The course material isn't too difficult, but Packard is an awful lecturer. He blows by the content extremely quickly and does not give enough examples. I learned most of the content on my own by doing practice problems and whatnot.  Whatsmore, he's somewhat of a cruel human being... he took attendance a total of three times between all the lectures and he purposely took attendance the day before Thanksgiving break (although he openly told some students that he wouldn't do that because it would be mean just a week earlier). He also put content on the final that he didn't cover in lecture.  If you have the option to take a different intro stats course, do it. Steer clear of this course as long as Kevin Packard is teaching it. ",ILRST 2100,1098

Great way to fill a stats distribution if you need it.",ILRST 2100,1098
M. Karns,3,1,2,"This class is a bit of a joke, at least during covid times. One can easily get by with minimal effort. All exams were replaced with weekly quizzes for covid, but the quizzes were all fairly short and mostly multiple choice. The class almost felt too easy, like I didn't learn as much as I could have. If you don't plan on doing anything stats related with your major and just need to get an intro class out of the way for credit, this class is for you. The professor was very accommodating, but rather passive aggressive at times. The final project was a 1500 word essay and study design on how cheating in classes hurts people.",ILRST 2100,1098

She goes over introductory probability for a long time and then once the harder material hits she goes pretty fast. She's great at explaining things in office hours (she's an awesome person!), but TA discussion sections were pointless, only about 6 of us went each week and did not gain much.

Assignments were once-weekly quizzes which involved searching through the textbook for the right formula and then plugging in the given numbers. Professor Wells, while a very nice and helpful teacher, constructed lectures that were purely walls of equations that made no sense to me or anyone I knew in the class. I expected to bomb the class but it turned out that understanding the lectures was not at all necessary to do well on the final (cheat sheet with equations allowed).

He blows by the content extremely quickly and does not give enough examples. I learned most of the content on my own by doing practice problems and whatnot.  Whatsmore, he's somewhat of a cruel human being... he took attendance a total of three times between all the lectures and he purposely took attendance the day before Thanksgiving break (although he openly told some students that he wouldn't do that because it would be mean just a week earlier). He also put content on the final that he didn't cover in lecture.  If you have the option to take a different intro stats course, do it.

If you don't plan on doing anything stats related with your major and just need to get an intro class out of the way for credit, this class is for you.

Walker White,5,3,4,Took Intro to Digital Product Design that's taught by Cornell AppDev. This class was incredible and really helped me get into the field of product design with a case study for my portfolio at the end! The course staff was always super helpful and weekly critique was cool because you could see what other students were working on and also get feedback. Workload is definitely on the heavier side but it's one of those classes where you get out what you put in.,INFO 1998,1107

David Easley,4,3,3,Very well organized. One pset a week that takes 2-3 hours. Only one prelim and one final that isn't too difficult. Everything you need to know will be taught.,INFO 2040,1108
David Easley,3,3,3,"I found the material very interesting. We had problem sets almost every week, in total 9 problem sets, with the worst one dropped. The grading is pain in the ass though, because they grade it unnecessarily harsh as if they are trying to make the course seem artificially more difficult. I wouldn't say that the material is difficult, the graders are just bad. They would acknowledge that your answer is correct but not give you the full credit because apparently it's not in the form that they wanted you to answer it. And as if that wasn't bad enough by itself they also make you type the answers because they can't be bothered reading the handwritten answers. Overall it is an interesting course if you take it for S/U and not worry about the ass graders.",INFO 2040,1108

David Easley,4,3,3,The topics discussed in this class were pr interesting sometimes. Definitely one of the better required classes I had to take. I took it online and the lectures were very boring but helpful for the homework. There was a pset every week with breaks every now and then. The psets take like 4-8 hours depending on the length and content. I def had to go to office hours for help. Shoutout to TA Marissa the OG. Also there was blog posts you have to do which are pr much 100s as long you put in some work.

I had to go to office hours multiple times every week.",INFO 2300,1109
Kyle Harms,5,3,3,"Loved this class! Kyle cares so much about his students and you can tell he is passionate about it. A good way to learn HTML/CSS and a little bit of SQL. Projects can feel tedious because they require a lot of writing and design justifications, but overall not too hard. If you go to lecture and pay attention to labs, you will be able to complete the work on time and do well.",INFO 2300,1109
Kyle Harms,5,3,5,"Very solid experience overall. I didn't took 1300 beforehand, so it was hard to catch up HTML and CSS work at the beginning. Kyle is extremely organized and he really  cares students' experience. Learning php and sql backend was foundational helpful in web dev. Projects were a lot of work but so rewarding.",INFO 2300,1109
Kyle Harms,4,2,3,"This class wasn't very difficult. The projects themselves are broken up into milestones which definitely helps keep you on track. You learn about PHP and basic fullstack development. It kind of sucks that PHP is outdated, but I guess the logic is pretty similar. The projects can take a while though if you want to make them really nice. it really depends on how much you care. You can do the minimum without much work, but if you want it to look really good and be really high quality, it might take more time. Kyle Harms is really nice though, really great professor.",INFO 2300,1109
Kyle Harms,4,3,4,"Really helpful class, I took it without taking 1300. As long as you know some html and css you should be good. Highly application based class, although most of the stuff you kinda have to learn on your own but  on the upside there is no exam.",INFO 2300,1109
Kyle Harms,4,2,4,Very useful class to learn the basics of backend web development in terms of understanding basic concepts. The professor is very considerate in assigning deadlines and helpful in aiding students. Everything for the class was well structured and everything is organized. Not that much workload until the final project submission.,INFO 2300,1109
Kyle Harms,4,3,3,"Took the class with Professor Harms. Good lecturer but the lectures are very slow and structured. Overall the class is pretty good an introduction to backend web development. The class covered mostly PHP and SQl but you needed to use HTML, CSS, and JS to do the assignments. There weren't any prelims or a final for the class but there was a milestone or a final submission due each week that took a decent amount of time. You could definitely take INFO 2300 without INFO 1300 as long as you are somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS but the first assignment will be painful.",INFO 2300,1109

Kyle Harms,3,4,4,"While I did learn a lot of PHP and did well in the class, project 3 was extremely difficult and not worth my time at all. There is not enough help in office hours. There were sometimes 50 people in the hallways waiting for one TA. The lab sections are not helpful at all either. Bright side is that there is no exams or final, just projects.

In my year (2021 Fall), we had six short essays, and all six were graded by a single TA instead of cycling by assignment. The three tests were online, and studying for them did absolutely nothing.

Mimno is a really charismatic and caring professor, but lectures were pretty dry and you can totally do the problem sets without them. This class is a nice introduction to learning how to use Python to work with data, clean it, and visualize it, but that's about it.

Great class if you are interested in the subject at all. There was also only 1 midterm and a final project instead of an exam.  Problem sets take up a lot of time, but office hours are super helpful and are your friend!!!!",INFO 2950,1113

Paul Ginsparg,-,4,-,"This was a great class and you learn a lot about python, counting and probability. I found the assignments very rewarding and they helped me learn a lot of Python and Data Science. I think Paul Ginsparg is a very smart guy, but sometimes he is not able to clearly explain the concepts because he goes over them too quickly or uses a poor method to elaborate. As a result, students end up being confused and have to read up online to understand the material.",INFO 2950,1113

Paul Ginsparg,-,5,-,Professor Ginsparg is brilliant but just does not communicate the material well. The class is extremely difficult and requires a ton of time spent in office hours. Problem sets take on average 10 hours. Means on the midterm and final are extremely low (50s-60s),INFO 2950,1113
Shimon Edelman,-,2,-,"This is potentially the weirdest class I've ever taken at Cornell. Professor Edelman wrote the textbook that you have to buy, then quoted himself in the lecture slides that he wrote as if he didn't write the textbook. This entire discipline seemed like something that he made up himself so he could teach a class about it and hear himself talk. Your entire grade in the class is 3 exams that are legit 5 multiple choice questions and 2 short answers. I got a 75 on one of the exams I studied hard for and a 98 on one of the exams where I legitimately made everything up. This class legit could be an easy A or an easy D it's unpredictable. Don't go to lecture because it is painfully boring to sit through and do the readings before the exam and hope for the best. But also just don't take this class.",INFO 3140,1114
Shimon Edelman,4,2,1,"Professor Edelman really changed up the structure of the class in response to virtual class and he seems to care about his students. A virtual semester consists of small weekly readings with annotations on Perusall and a weekly micro essay about the topic of the week with a max of 500 words. Topics are really interesting and light work kept me motivated, but I could see how a semester with prelims and finals could make the content seem tedious.",INFO 3140,1114
Walker White,2,3,5,"This class made me hate video games even more. As a UX designer, no one on the programming team cared enough about my opinions.

Some teams worked excellently together and got matching t-shirts by the end of the course, while others had half their team drop out. Not that many people go to lecture. Workload dependent on how hard your team wants to try. Class also makes you realize why code formatters and lint tools exist.

Walker White,5,3,5,"Far by one of the best courses I have ever taken as it is interdisciplinary with both programmers and designers so you get to experience working from different perspectives, quite enjoyable, and the work you put in really pays off. Took this class in Spring 2020 so the second half of the semester was spent online instead of in-person. Difficulty and workload is unique to each individual group. Each person is expected to contribute a reasonable amount but some students do more than necessary to refine their game. One thing I did not expect was the amount of writing and documentation that was required, but these documents are beneficial as they teach standard writing guidelines and even now I use the principles for writing my own documents.",INFO 3152,1115

The material focuses on different aspects of media (like social media, internet etc) and how it affects society. Prof. Duffy is also lot of fun in class and you hear all about her ducks. There are readings, which are usually links to newspapers or magazine articles, for every class and use Twitter to comment on the readings. There are a lot of different things that you have to submit through out the semester -- essays, discussion posts, tweets on reading in addition to prelims, and it's very easy to lose track. Other than that, it's a great class!",INFO 3200,1116

David Mimno,-,2,-,"This class was very okay. Mimno won't be teaching it again, so I'm not sure how it will change, but when I took it it started slow with Javascript for loops and other basic stuff like that. There are multiple partner projects with randomly assigned students, and I had to carry both of my groups, which was extremely frustrating. One partner dropped out of the class a few days before the project was due after promising he was making progress on his work. By the end of the class, it was just D3. Honestly, I don't feel like I got a lot of value out of it and wouldn't recommend it. Charting isn't super interesting at this level and most of the class felt inconsequential.",INFO 3300,1117
Jeff Rzeszotarski,5,2,3,"The class with Jeff is amazing and definitely a good idea to take as a tech elective if you are CS.  It is really enjoyable and very interesting.  BUT it is not a class where you can just never pay attention and get an A but if you do pay attention and keep up with the work and lectures it is not that hard at all.  Weekly problem sets, weekly quizzes, a couple of group projects, and a take home final make up your grade.",INFO 3300,1117

Jeff Rzeszotarski,5,2,2,"I took this class with Rzeszotarksi (FA22) and the class was not super challenging. The professor gives you weekly coding assignments that generally follow the lectures so they are not super hard to complete. There are two group projects throughout the semester and a take-home final. The groups are randomly assigned so be aware of this. Overall, you learn a lot about d3 and Javascript and I think it was a great class to get you into making data visualizations. ",INFO 3300,1117

Gilly Leshed,2,4,5,"I thought this class had so much potential, but I was really disappointed in Professor Leshed. I found her incredibly standoff-ish and confrontational when students asked questions. She doesn't encourage learning and never answers questions in an understanding and sympathetic way.  As well, I have found the value of the subject area drowned out by the excessive work that is assigned. The class is a single, extended group project, but each section of the project is incredibly time intensive and there is a lot of subjectivity in the grading.",INFO 3450,1119
Gilly Leshed,5,3,5,"I really like this class! The workload is quite hearty with all the individual and group assignments.

Gilly Leshed,5,3,5,"If you have any career aspirations of working in UX Research or Product Design this is the class to take at Cornell. Gilly is a kind encouraging professor who gives clear, concise, and informative lectures. This course teaches you the important theoretical underpinnings of user experience design and gives you a formal language to ground one's design decisions. If you work hard on the group project, you can have a great portfolio piece by the end. However, I strongly recommend taking a course in visual design and using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, etc prior  to this course (i.e Intro to Digital Product Design). One criticism I have is that TA grading seems haphazard sometimes overly critical. There is a lot of busy work involved, but it is the difference between good and bad design.  Any negative reviews for this course is straight cap",INFO 3450,1119
Gilly Leshed,5,2,4,"Took this class over summer of 2020 so instruction was online and asynchronous. Because of this the paper prototypes and user interviews were also conducted online. A semester's worth of material is condensed into around 2 months so the workload was not light. There were daily writing prompts, weekly projects, and group meetings very weekend. The material was easily digestible, despite each project taking a fair amount of time to complete, and the course TAs were very responsive and modified the syllabus to fit the overall situation.",INFO 3450,1119
Gilly Leshed,5,3,5,"This class is a ton of work, but I loved it! It's a great introduction to HCI, and you definitely learn a ton as the semester project takes you through the entire design process. I've seen mixed reviews about this class, but I really believe that it's what you make of it. If you don't put in the work or you slack, you're not going to do well. But if you're genuinely interested in learning the content and working with your group members, you'll have a great time. Expect to put in a ton of work though as the milestones for the project often involve very lengthy reports.",INFO 3450,1119

Lectures were dry and can probably be taught in 15 min (instead of 75 min) but the discussions were actually fun and used the HCI methods taught in class. Each component of the semester project contained an excessive amount of writing (almost as much as a technical writing course) and interviewing, but my group didn't find it difficult to score well on the project.  I recommend this class if you need it for fulfilling INFO requirements and for boosting your grade",INFO 3450,1119

It's definitely not an easy A so be prepared to work and learn a ton. Professor Leshed is a terrific lecturer who is always super organized and excited about her work. Grades are based primarily on the group assignments which really rests on who you end up with (groups are randomly formed) but are not bad at all if you get started early and have at least one person who's passionate about design in your group. My only complaint would be that assignments sometimes seem to be pretty tedious and not really reflective of how user-centered design is done in the industry (for example, for one part of an assignment we had to make a paper stop motion video of our app AND THEN redo it digitally like c'mon).

The professor reminds me of those English teachers that read way too far into what the author actually meant, conjuring up doubtful interpretations that he treats as fact. He makes you buy his textbook by making the material in it required for some design workbooks, but the ""textbook"" is literally just a collection of PDFs from other books/articles stitched together.

Phoebe Sengers,5,2,3,"Phoebe's an inspiring professor and pushes you to think outside of the box for social-driven design. As an info sci major, it's really great (and important) to have this class force you to think about designing outside the realm of technology.",INFO 4240,1124
Phoebe Sengers,4,3,3,"Interesting class that forces users to think outside of the box. Focuses heavily on idea making process rather than designing full blown products, but has good intentions. Workload is manageable, with two short papers every week.",INFO 4240,1124
Phoebe Sengers,-,1,-,This course is very boring and things you do feel useless. They need to redesign course structure. I do not recommend this course to anybody.,INFO 4240,1124
Phoebe Sengers,-,2,-,"The class is very polarizing, in that some people absolutely love it and some people hate it. I belong to the latter category. It's a class where you talk in abstractions thinking that you're finding truth and discovering new perspectives - but it's all pretty delusional. The many design responses and miniprojects are essentially just busy work - I feel like I've spent a semester just thinking of random things that the TAs would find stimulating, but have not learned a single thing. You will start off taking this class thinking it'll be easy enough, but may be absolutely frustrated towards the end of the semester.",INFO 4240,1124
Phoebe Sengers,-,4,-,"This class has useful and interesting content regarding design, but should not be a 3 credit class. There are at least three assignments due weekly, so it can be a lot of work. However, due to the abundance of work, you tend to learn the information better. I don't find the lectures to be particularly useful.",INFO 4240,1124
Phoebe Sengers,-,1,-,"Attending lecture is not mandatory but they can be interesting and fun to listen to. There are two writing assignments a week that each take around 10-20 minutes. There are also readings for each class of an article or academic paper. These readings are my favorite part of the class as they really bring a new perspective to technology and design. There are also miniprojects that are due every couple weeks and these takes a couple hours at most. No prelims and one take home final. Overall, this class is really easy to do on your own without attending lecture but I think that the content is really interesting.",INFO 4240,1124

Karen Levy,5,3,3,"One of my favorite classes at Cornell- it really makes you think about the implications of tech on society!  The discussions that take place in lecture are really interesting and make you think outside the box.  The professor's passion for the material really shows and this helps the class feel more engaged.  There are very few assignments (about 3-4 the whole semester) so each is worth a lot when determining your final grade, but if you make sure to take time to do your research and review your papers, you'll be fine.  Participation is key so try to attend lectures!",INFO 4250,1125

Karen Levy,5,2,2,"This is an awesome class. Professor Levy is so nice and treats students like equals. The entire lectures are really just conversations between her and the class. For a 4000 level course, there is very little work--readings for each course and three short essays. The content is super relevant and the class is a great place to learn.",INFO 4250,1125
Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,2,1,1,"Topic is interesting, however class moves pretty slowly due to an overly high emphasis on in-class participation, and practical demos, which are often hard to follow and not too helpful, with a lot of unnecessary and basic questions asked and waiting involved for class participation. Would have preferred less time spent on demos and more time on the theory/concepts behind IR design. Professor also doesn't post any notes to try to force you to come to class. Workload is very light.",INFO 4300,1126

Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,5,2,3,"I took this class for the NLP content, but I ended up really enjoying learning about IR systems. The course overall is pretty light from the material itself to the assignments. The final project is a bit more demanding, but I agree with past reviews that it has taught me so much about what full-stack development actually looks like. DNM as a professor is also an engaging lecturer and just fun overall. The one thing I disliked was not having recorded lectures or posted notes for when I occasionally missed writing down something and couldn't refer to it anywhere. Otherwise, I learned a lot and highly recommend this class!",INFO 4300,1126

Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,5,2,2,This class was one of the best classes I've taken at Cornell. The topic is very interesting and Prof DNM does a really good job explaining everything. He is an engaging lecturer and focuses on building your intuition around class topics so that you know how to apply the methods you learn. There are weekly assignments for the first half of the semester that are pretty straightforward and interesting. The second half of the semester revolves around creating your own recommendation system for pretty much anything you want. Prof DNM is also very fair in terms of grades. He really wants everyone to understand the material and succeed in the class. I would recommend taking this class if you have even the slightest interest in IR or NLP.,INFO 4300,1126
Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,3,2,1,"Class was generally interesting, but the lectures move really slowly and aren't that important in terms of learning the material.  The assignments were straightforward and did not require a lot of effort.  In addition, the final project doesn't take up a lot of time and can be rewarding.",INFO 4300,1126
Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil,5,2,3,"This is a relatively easy class that, during the final project, taught me more about coordinating a full-stack web app than any other experience at Cornell. This is a class in which you get as much out of it as you put in, and though class can be somewhat boring/slow at times, DNM is hilarious and you end up learning a great blend of information retrieval, NLP, and full stack development along the way.",INFO 4300,1126
Christopher Buckley,-,3,-,"I took the class in Spring 2018. The contents of the class were pretty useful and interesting, you come across these concepts in other classes such as NLP for example. I personally thought the assignments were well-designed and not too hard. There was a final group project (around 5 people per team) and how good the project goes will depend on the team you form. The class was definitely worth it, educational and also rewarding in terms of grades (as the median was an A).",INFO 4300,1126
Jeff Rzeszotarski,3,2,4,This class is a lot more work on CS 3300 as homeworks are a lot more up to you. There are write ups for each homework assignment to talk about the story behind your visualization.,INFO 4310,1127
Jeff Rzeszotarski,4,3,4,"More of a discussion based class, compared to the pre-req INFO 3300. There were three HWs, which were more like the projects from INFO 3300, and a final project. I had a good time with it, but your group members definitely play a role in your experience. If you've never coded in javascript before, I wouldn't take this class.

Francois Guimbretiere,4,4,5,"The class was really fun! You get to learn Arduino, laser-cutting, CAD, and 3d-printing throughout the semester, culminating in a final project of your own design. However the workload grows dramatically in the second half of the semester as you balance the final project and other assignments, and without previous experience or a really great group, it can be very difficult to complete.",INFO 4320,1128

Cheng Zhang,5,4,4,"This class was absolutely awesome. The material was so interesting and is a great starter class for someone trying to learn hardware. Professor Zhang is very accommodating, but is a little vague in assignments some times. This class has a heavy workload, but it's manageable if you go to office hours when you need help.",INFO 4320,1128
Francois Guimbretiere,4,2,4,"Very fun but a lot of consistent work.  You need to be very self-directed in the semester long group project but the TAs and prof are helpful when you ask for help.  For certain projects fulfilling the requirements is considered the bare minimum ""c"" so that's annoying.",INFO 4320,1128
Kyle Harms,3,2,4,"This course definitely has a few coding-heavy assignments that I struggled a bit in but OH is definitely a lifesaver in this class. The group project (50-60% of your grade) experience is very dependent on your group members but is fairly management, though a bit quick-paced.",INFO 4340,1129
Kyle Harms,3,3,3,"This is a decent class. There are a few coding/vue assignments and a lot of design assignments, but the design assignments may be fairly redundant if you have knowledge of the design process and have worked on UX projects before. The professor is very passionate but that can come off as intimidating sometimes. There's a group project where your teammates are randomly assigned. Workload is inconsistent, some weeks (coding assignments) have  a lot of work, while other weeks have fairly little.",INFO 4340,1129

However, homework assignments are still sometimes fairly tedious and annoying.",INFO 4400,1130
Gilly Leshed,5,2,4,"A really interesting class if you're really into design theory and HCI and have exhausted every other HCI class lol. I feel like other classes like HCI Studio with Francois teach the same thing over and over again but this class really goes into abstract design methods (feminist design, ethnographic studies, undesign, etc.) that you may not use in industry but are still super interesting to learn about. I'd stay away if this is your first design class though because most of the work is readings and designing a project that may or may not exactly be an app/website. Gilly is one of the most organized professors I've ever met and she's super knowledgable!",INFO 4400,1130

Francois Guimbretiere,5,3,3,"INFO 4420 - This course is in a workshop form therefore you spend time working together with your team during the session and your instructor would come to give advice and work with you on the progress. The good thing about this course is that you get a chance to work on something you would like to explore for the entire semester and you get guidance for every part of process which would be helpful for your portfolio.

Francois Guimbretiere,4,2,3,I went in thinking this would be a product design class like DPD but really its all about designing a solution for a world problem (physical or virtual). You don't really learn anything new tbh and there are barely any lectures.

If you work hard on the group project, you can have a great portfolio piece by the end. However, I strongly recommend taking a course in visual design and using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, etc prior  to this course (i.e Intro to Digital Product Design).

One partner dropped out of the class a few days before the project was due after promising he was making progress on his work. By the end of the class, it was just D3.

I found her incredibly standoff-ish and confrontational when students asked questions. She doesn't encourage learning and never answers questions in an understanding and sympathetic way.  As well, I have found the value of the subject area drowned out by the excessive work that is assigned.

Gilly Leshed,5,3,5,"If you have any career aspirations of working in UX Research or Product Design this is the class to take at Cornell. Gilly is a kind encouraging professor who gives clear, concise, and informative lectures. This course teaches you the important theoretical underpinnings of user experience design and gives you a formal language to ground one's design decisions. If you work hard on the group project, you can have a great portfolio piece by the end. However, I strongly recommend taking a course in visual design and using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, etc prior  to this course (i.e Intro to Digital Product Design). One criticism I have is that TA grading seems haphazard sometimes overly critical. There is a lot of busy work involved, but it is the difference between good and bad design.  Any negative reviews for this course is straight cap",INFO 5355,1138

A semester's worth of material is condensed into around 2 months so the workload was not light. There were daily writing prompts, weekly projects, and group meetings very weekend. The material was easily digestible, despite each project taking a fair amount of time to complete, and the course TAs were very responsive and modified the syllabus to fit the overall situation.",INFO 5355,1138

But that's the nature of learning a language -- if you have constant exposure to it, it will be easier and faster to learn it.",JAPAN 1101,1152

Misako Chapman,5,4,4,"A little more difficult than J1101, but with that foundation you are able to learn so much more and express many more ideas in this course. Terashima Sensei is very nice and explains material well during lecture, and is accessible for office hours outside of class. Sections are engaging and same style as J1101 and practice the content that was learned before. Final project is an essay and presentation.",JAPAN 1102,1153

When I was sick/lost my voice, she was very understanding and accommodating. This teacher will literally answer your emails within an hour, whether you send it at 8am or 2am. It was very well organized and you can tell how much work and care the teachers put into teaching the course!",JAPAN 2201,1154

You learn more sentences and grammar structures such as passive, causative, causative passive, and you go more into reading and written Japanese from Tobira chapters 1-3, and also you do more discussions in Japanese which is fun.",JAPAN 2201,1154
Naomi Larson,5,4,5,"Great course, and Larson Sensei is very helpful and encouraging. The course goes through the next 6 or so chapters of Tobira, and Larson Sensei pushes you to use grammar and parts that you learn from the text.

As long as you do the work, you'll get an A/A+. The workload picked up a decent amount in 1103, but it was still manageable.

Shalom is hands down the best professor I've had at Cornell and is funny and interesting and makes this class super easy. You get to see every test and quiz in advance and have nightly homeworks that you can correct before submitting meaning if you put in the work and attend class everyday, you will get an A or A+. Sometimes we watch movies and he brings in snacks too. It is everyday which is annoying but worth getting up for and saved my GPA for 3 semesters.",JWST 1101,1157

I'm not religious, but I've always been interested in reading the Bible, so this was a cool intro to some of the scholarly subjects relating to the New Testament.

I took this class after completing SPAN 2095 and I would recommend taking other higher-level classes before taking this one. Since the readings are from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the old Spanish used is different from modern-day Spanish and is much more difficult to understand. The class also included a lot of class discussions which was difficult for me since many of the other students were native speakers.",LATA 2170,1169

Material has a slight overlap with her other class, but generally the two classes cover different topics. There were  readings every class, two problem sets and a non-cumulative multiple choice exam. Problem sets were tedious but not terrible, but exam was very tough and made you look at exact wording of question to figure out correct answer. Despite this, would recommend the class to anyone vaguely interested in the Supreme court or Law School.",LAW 3281,1172

Dawn Chutkow,3,4,3,"Professor Chutkow has a sense of humor and she relates well with students. Class is not too bad; sometimes the legal reasoning can get a little convoluted (especially in terms of tort law) so make sure you follow with the readings and lectures. Grade primarily is based on two hypothetical problem sets, in which you are presented with a set of facts and must apply legal reasoning/facts from cases in the readings to your own set of facts. Would suggest you go to office hours for assistance as these are graded pretty harshly. Overall, the class is not impossible but make sure you get help if you need it.",LAW 4131,1173
Dawn Chutkow,5,3,3,"Took this class Spring 2019 and absolutely loved it. Learned a lot about a number of different types of legal issues and cases to explain them. Professor Chutkow is a phenomenal teacher who consistently engaged all the students in lecture despite being a large class.

In addition, Prof. Chutkow is honestly the best professor I've had at Cornell -- she's always able to present the material in an engaging and relevant way and makes lecture 100% worth going to. There are two case analysis homework assignments, occasional section meetings that substitute for lectures, and multiple-choice exams.

Sam Tilsen,3,3,3,"I took Professor Tilsen's course Spring 2021. I enjoyed the material and the homeworks were fun when they were not overly challenging. The synchronous lectures are taught well by the professor, however, he goes EXTREMELY fast so it is very hard to stay with him in lecture if you are also trying to take notes. The support in this class seems to be lacking as well. The professor ends the zoom calls immediately after lecture is over so no one can ask questions and there is no asynchronous way to ask questions (ie a discussion board). There are office hours, but the TAs seem to be lacking in the actually material of the course even though they are clearly very talented in the linguistics field. I have heard the professor and more frequently TAs say something along the lines of if you knew more linguistics it would make sense. Besides these downfalls the lectures are geared towards an intro course and are very helpful to look back at, and the textbook is also helpful. Overall, this class is interesting and a medium workload (homework due every week, 2 analysis papers due throughout the semester, and a final).",LING 1101,1178
Miloje Despic,4,3,2,"The class was really interesting and covered a lot of different topics within linguistics. However, the assignments were harder and more complicated than one would expect.

The problem sets were overall fun, but I felt that as the semester went on they got a little more chore-like than interesting.

Miloje Despic,4,2,2,The material is very interesting. The online lectures are engaging. The TAs are really responsible. My TA creates discussion worksheets based on that week's problem set so the psets aren't challenging at all. My TA also emails everyone in his discussion for things to look out for in the pset and give hints. The online tests on Canvas were annoying because we can't go back to previous questions.

Although it did require a lot of memorization of sound changes, the lectures followed the textbook very closely so studying wasn't too difficult. Professor Alkire is so nice and extremely knowledgeable about the subject - he had an answer to pretty much every random question brought up in class, and if he didn't, he went to the library for the answer and told us during the next class. Workload is pretty light but there is some rather dense reading. He said at the beginning that ""As long as you show up to lecture and try your best you'll get a good grade."" Material is super interesting if you like romance languages. I've never really been a phonetics/phonology person but this class may have changed that - our relative chronology problems are actually pretty fun.

The lectures are based off the textbook and are somehow made more confusing. You're better off reading the textbook than going to lecture. The grades and projects are never released on time, yet they still expect the students to somehow meet the deadline.",LING 4474,1189
Claire Cardie,2,5,5,"I came into the class with high expectations for NLP but this class really disappointed me by the way it's taught and kind of killed some of my interest of the subject. The lectures didn't prepare me for the projects at all. We went through algorithms in class but nothing about the implementation conventions. If you are not familiar with PyTorch and all those NLP packages, it will be a huge pain to search the documentation and often I didn't even know where to start because no one tells me what to look at. Thus, the projects are super time-consuming. I spent much more time on this class than on 3410 which is known for its heavy workload. Also, idk if it's bc the class is in the morning, the lecture is super dry and dead, the professor and the PhD lecturer really lack some enthusiasm in teaching and thus made the material much less engaging than it should have been.",LING 4474,1189
Claire Cardie,1,5,5,"I hated this class. The lectures are extremely boring and never talk about the actual code. And they expect you to code an entire neural network. My friends and I were lost the entire time, I've never been so confused in a class.",LING 4474,1189
Claire Cardie,1,4,5,"I took this class because I want to learn about NLP, but was thoroughly disappointed on the course structure, or more accurately speaking, the lack of structure. CS 4740 was one of the classes that fit my schedule for Fall 2020 where I took this class online. Lectures were decent, but could be better, there was a technical microphone issue where the professor's audio was practically inaudible and students were not able to hear clearly. Project guidelines were long, open-ended, overly wordy, and required students to write tedious code that were not directly related to class material.",LING 4474,1189
Claire Cardie,-,3,-,"I really regret taking this class over my other options. Prof. Cardie's lectures are almost entirely based on Jurafsky's textbook. The examples and figures in her slides are straight from that textbook, and thus you can skip most of the lectures if you just do the reading. Honestly, I think reading the textbook is the more efficient way to learn the materials since her lectures are poorly organized. She spends a lot of time explaining linguistics concepts but not enough time on math and algorithms. This is very troublesome if you have a big project team (3-4 people), because you will be expected to implement logistic regression, MEMM, etc. She does not teach these algorithms that are necessary to finish your project but happily wastes time talking about IBM Watson, which is just an interesting side thing. In sum, her lectures are not informative; the projects have interesting topics but you have to do a lot of self-studying to do them properly and thus they may end up taking too much time. Deep learning is the future of NLP. You will be better off skipping this class and instead take the free Stanford online course Deep Learning for NLP.",LING 4474,1189
Lillian Lee,2,4,5,"I regret taking this class. Workload insane. Unorganized. As much as I still love both prof Lillian and Marten and the context, this class was a disaster. I put in so much effort and still ended up with my worst grade of the semester.",LING 4474,1189
Lillian Lee,2,4,4,"Took it with Lillian and Marty. Lillian didn't lecture, only Marty did and he wasn't the best. The organization of the course definitely needs improvement.

Claire Cardie,3,3,3,"Professor Cardie got rid of exams for COVID-19. Overall the class was interesting but very disorganized- the projects are super vague and take up a lot of time just figuring out what to do. TAs had to have emergency office hours at midnight because a ton of students struggled to submit an assignment the night of. Also, the professor had a graduate student lecturing half the time and the quality of those was not as good/hard to follow which was disappointing. The structure of the class didn't make sense as a hybrid (like breakout rooms when half the students are in-person and half online).",LING 4474,1189
Claire Cardie,2,4,4,"The content of the course can be interesting and helpful if you are genuinely interested in NLP. It is a very project-heavy course where we implement the different models learned in lectures, which takes a lot of time. I had three projects with a partner and the last one alone. No finals or prelims this semester. The lectures are very theoretical, so it can take extra work to translate all the information into code. Prof. Cardie did make it a little interactive by using breakout rooms. We had a few quizzes throughout the semester, which were fine if you go through practice questions. Also had to write a one-page critique paper on different research papers, not too hard, but would have liked more feedback/guidance on that.",LING 4474,1189
Jonathan Park,-,4,-,"THE single most disorganized class I have ever taken. I was really excited about the subject material, but this class was very poorly executed. Lectures are okay (kinda boring, but Claire is clearly very knowledgeable and a sweetheart). But the TAs are entirely responsible for the projects and as a result they are far too underspecified (most people don't even know where to start) and only about 1 TA will understand it well enough to help. For one project, the class was so clueless that they had to hold a 3 hour Saturday lecture (**the day before it was due**) just to explain what the project was asking.",LING 4474,1189

Exams are harder than the homework problems (best way to study is to take old exams).  I went to OH once and asked the TA about a homework problem and he didn't seem to know how to do it, so I recommend going to either professor OH or Head TA OH. It can be hard to get help since most of the other students don't really know what they're doing (at least not at an A level) and OH can be scheduled at inconvenient/impossible times, but a B is very achievable.",MATH 1920,1216

Yuri Berest,5,2,4,"Took it with Professor Alex Townsend. He made everything SO EASY. Even the hardest concepts, he would explain so well that it becomes so easy to digest. 10/10 recommend.",MATH 2940,1222
Yuri Berest,4,4,3,"(I had professor Townsend)This class was great! Coming from the college of Engineering and being a CS major, Math 2940 is a requirement and it was A LOT less painful than Math 1910 and Math 1920 in terms of workload, difficulty, and exams. Professor Townsend was a great professor he made the homework fair and the exams had a nice bell curve with around a 75 mean. My one complaint is that he tends to be more on the theoretical side and this is evident on his exams. Either way, the exams were still VERY fair and his door was always open for office hours. He had a very engaging lecture and he does great example problems in lectures that definitely prepare students for the homework assignments; he is also very organized. Overall, the workload was not too bad, the class didn't stress me out a lot and I would definitely recommend it!",MATH 2940,1222
Yuri Berest,4,2,3,"Took in Fall 2020 (remote) with Professor Alex Townsend. Unlike many remote classes, my lecture session was entirely remote, meaning the the prof directly interacted with students over zoom instead of lecturing to a classroom. This helped my experience a lot as I could ask questions directly during class. The material was not to bad, although it got much tougher in the last few weeks, although I did take linear algebra in high school so I definitely had an advantage there. However, my peers who had no prior exposure to linear algebra seem to agree that the material isn't so bad, and Townsend is generally very helpful with questions. Normally there is 1 homework drop but he gave us a second the last week of class, which was nice.  He also has a nice British accent (he's British) which makes lectures nice to listen to and he appreciates memes (although he's not very well-versed). The problem sets are not very long, with a few questions per textbook section, and the last question is a multi-part one that he wrote himself. Usually the last question is more difficult than the textbook problems, so I recommend working with classmates",MATH 2940,1222
Yuri Berest,5,3,3,"I took it with Professor Townsend, and I highly recommend taking it with him! It's engineering math so it isn't proof focussed, however at the end of each hw there's a project question that encourages you to think about an interesting application of the topics you covered that week. His exams are quite hard but quite fair imo, and it's all curved in the end. His zoom lectures were really good, he got a special camera and everything to be able to write on the blackboard, and I think he's a really good lecturer! I recommend going to office hours if you're curious about more advanced concepts related to the course content.",MATH 2940,1222
Laurent Saloff-Coste,2,1,1,"The first 1/3 of this class was really easy and was a review of high school material. The next 1/3 was new material, but it was also incredibly easy. I believe I got away with only 1-2h per week on homework. The last 1/3 of this class really ramped up and covered some difficult and abstract concepts. When I took it, the prelims were set really easy (like a median of 90) and the final was set ridiculously difficult. The gotcha about this class is that you have to attend discussion sections to take quizzes which account for a certain amount of your grade. The discussion sections provide good practice but provided little value (You might as well do those questions on your own time). The professor did not teach well and spends much of his lectures reviewing past material while not sufficiently covering new material. I find that the textbook does a lot better job explaining the course material than the professor. Having a good knowledge of linear algebra (mainly the first half of this class) is key for many upper level CS classes so pay attention to the material.",MATH 2940,1222
Yuri Berest,5,3,3,I took this class with Prof. Townsend. He's so amazing! He's really good at teaching and the class is really organized. The homeworks he gives are questions from the textbook graded based on completion and one question not from the textbook graded based on accuracy. The textbook questions were reasonable and so were the non-textbook questions. His homeworks were enjoyable to do because they generally weren't too difficult. His exams are challenging but fair. He's also very friendly and approachable!,MATH 2940,1222
Damek Davis,4,2,3,"The class wasn't very burdensome with prof. Davis. There wasn't much h/w compared to other engineer math classes (e.g. multivar calculus), and the discussion sessions were helpful in supplementing the classes. Piazza response time was acceptable, and there were relatively active discussions between the students, too. The professor is inviting when it comes to questions, trying to address most of the questions for him. The exams were relatively easy, resulting in 39/43 avg. in the second prelim, so it was less burdensome. However, there didn't seem to be a lot of takeaways, too.",MATH 2940,1222
Laurent Saloff-Coste,2,4,3,"The content itself is not very difficult, but the prelims are very conceptual, and since everyone did well on the prelim, he curves the median to a B even if the median is a 90. It is really hard to get a high grade in the class",MATH 2940,1222
Adrian Lewis,3,2,3,"He was a decent lecturer, often gave a two minute break during class (because he was British). A lot of people stop going to class because everything is in the textbook, but going to lecture and putting some effort in paying attention makes it a lot easier to get a good grade. Doing the homework and making sure you understand it is really important. It is a lot of memorization of terms. Not too hard.",MATH 2940,1222

It's not a difficult course if you do the homework and some extra problems as needed.             Median: B",MATH 2940,1222
Adrian Lewis,2,3,4,"The lecture is rather theoretical and frustrating (Honestly, this is the most frustrating and boring lecture in my freshman year). Adrian mainly discusses proof every lecture but this would not be tested at all and the proof is too abstract to follow.

Otherwise, listen carefully to TA's review during recitation.",MATH 2940,1222

Yuri Berest,-,2,-,"I took this class with Professor Saloff-Coste and found it pretty easy, with a very manageable workload. This prof made it very interesting and engaging (he was really incredible for a math teacher!); my only issue with him is that he tends to jump around nonsensically from topic to topic, and his lectures really wouldn't make sense without reading the textbook beforehand. There was one problem set per week which took me only about 2-3 hours, and every hw assignment for the semester is laid out on the course website from day 1 so it's very easy to stay on top of the work. The course website encourages reading the textbook before lecture and I would REALLY recommend doing that, since it made the lectures so much more valuable. It's a real time sink but well worth it in my opinion (and I thought the textbook was great). Overall I thought the way it was taught made it interesting and fun, I really didn't spend that much time doing work for this class even with reading the textbook, and the exams weren't hard (although the second prelim was curved down a full letter grade so watch out).",MATH 2940,1222

Alexander Vladimirsky,4,5,4,"I took this as a tech elective as a CS major online because of COVID. The big thing about this class is that you have to compete in math modeling competitions, the first being a 1-week long midterm project within the class, the second being the Cornell CMCM (1-weekend long project within Cornell that counts for a large part of your grade), and potentially the third being the international MCM if you win the Cornell CMCM. These are usually a lot of work because you're given a problem and have to create a math model + write a paper in a really short amount of time, but they're really hands-on and can be really interesting. Otherwise, there were weekly homeworks that were often challenging but the TA office hours were great, and Prof. Vladimirsky is a good lecturer who really wants to make sure everyone understands the material but it was hard to get engagement over Zoom. I personally don't think I'm good at math and struggled a bit to understand the material, but still learned a lot and overall thought this was a good tech elective.

The content was alright (really just a review of calc 1 and 2 with more proofs). I will say, Knutson is not an analyst and it shows, as this was also his first time teaching the course. Also, if you took 2230/2240, you will have already covered most of this material. Problem sets weren't too bad and we only had a final.

Prof Van Dover is very knowledgeable and the TAs were very helpful (although I didn't take advantage of this as I should have).  The remote lectures are technically synchronous, but the lecture sections are combined remote + in-person. What this meant was that the professor lectured to the in-person students, while a TA was in charge of the Zoom meeting. This meant that any questions asked were usually delayed, since the TA had to jot them down and wait for the professor to pause his lecture. On the other hand, in-person students could ask questions live and have them answered immediately. As for workload, the first 2/3 of the semester is much easier than the end, but that's because I stopped watching the lectures and tried to  learn by googling material. For the beginning, the material is fairly basic and even if you don't understand, you can just google concepts and get a surface level understanding. However, when more complicated topics come up, it's near-impossible to learn without watching the lectures or asking questions. If you plan to take this class, make sure you ask any",MSE 1140,1250
R. Van Dover,-,4,-,The first half of the semester was more of an intro mat sci course and we only got to sustainable energy in the second half so I found the course name to be a bit misleading. Umbach's lectures can be very fast at times and lose you easily but office hours are super helpful in actually understanding the material. The problem sets are relatively long and can be very difficult if you don't go to office hours. There were frequent iClicker questions in the beginning of the semester but tapered off towards the end.,MSE 1140,1250

Andrej Singer,5,3,3,Professor Singer was organized and coherent. The TA's for this course were fantastic. Resources were all present. Biggest issues was that PSets often had material covered the day they would do or after they were due.,MSE 2610,1252
Andrej Singer,4,3,3,"Prof. Singer was a pretty good lecturer. Going to office hours with the graduate TAs was really helpful since they explained concepts well. The exams were fair, and the final exam was oral.",MSE 2610,1252
Andrej Singer,4,3,4,"Took it fall 2018. Professor Singer was a decently organized lecturer and would give real life examples of the concepts he was talking about. It was a bit difficult figuring out how to apply concepts onto the problem sets, but Professor Singer gave us Professor Baker's notes which helped immensely. The TAs Dan and Yiren were super helpful as well during office hours. If I remember correctly, the prelims and final were pretty fair; they made you use the same type of analytical thinking you need for the problem sets and force you to combine concepts while solving one problem.",MSE 2610,1252

You get assigned homework almost everyday though and it's all on handouts from class, so if you miss a lecture, you have to email him for the handouts. It was a bit unorganized, but overall, it was an easy A. Test were very straightforward.",MUSIC 1100,1255
Andrew Hicks,4,2,2,This class was really fun and you get to listen to music every lecture in an auditorium. You also get to try out some old musical instrument (can't remember what it's called). The course goes through basic music theory and talks about the history of music as well as certain genres of music. This class does not require you to be a musician or proficient in music. There are a number of projects that involve collecting sounds from around the school and making a composition but you're not graded on the quality of your composition but rather the thought that goes into it. I think this is a great class to fulfill liberal studies if you're in Engineering.,MUSIC 1101,1256
Andrew Hicks,4,1,1,[I took it with Prof Madrid . He wasn't listed and I couldn't put N/A] Not a difficult class.

Katherine Selby,-,3,-,"(I wrote this up and realized that I couldn't submit it because there was know professor selector, but I don't want to just throw out what I wrote so I'll leave it here. It's for Intro to Creative Writing). I really love this class. Having an outlet to express your thoughts in a controlled manner like this is extremely helpful. It's a bit nerve wracking to be sharing something personal to the class, but when you inevitably find that people like what you wrote it's honestly so rewarding. Writing and reading activities are pretty regular, but a lot of them are extremely fun and don't really feel like work. You could honestly really write about anything and it can be considered ""creative"", so grades aren't really an issue either. I put a Chance the Rapper verse in my short story just for fun and got props for it from my professor. You are only provided two absences though, so if you are allergic to going to class that might be an issue. Otherwise, take this class no matter the cost.",MUSIC 1466,1260
Katherine Selby,-,3,-,"This class is great. The physics doesn't really get any harder than high school level, and if you love music and instruments you will love this class. There are music/sound demo almost every class, and the professor is extremely passionate about teaching. I'm pretty sure she mentioned that she doesn't do research here and focuses on teaching, so you know she'll be giving her best effort. This class actually inspired me to pick up guitar this summer and I've been having a great time with it. The physics knowledge applied a lot and gave context to what I was doing. If you aren't strong in physics, it can be a bit difficult, but there is also a research paper at the end that can balance out your grade.",MUSIC 1466,1260
Jordan Musser,4,1,2,"Took the Music and Media section for my FWS freshman fall and enjoyed it. Readings were tough sometimes but we always discussed as a class and Jordan was chill even when we were like ""I didn't understand much cause it was hard to read"" cause then we'd just talk about what it meant. Workload was probably relatively low for an FWS, just written homeworks and a couple of essays where we got feedback which was really helpful. We had some cool topics and activities like going to the hip hop collection and having the opportunity to use the record players in the library, which I really enjoyed.",MUSIC 1701,1261

Roger Moseley,5,2,2,Professor Moseley is my dad. Such a talented musician and wonderful lecturer; lecture was engaging and he always offered cool examples of all the concepts we covered. Workload was definitely manageable especially if you are genuinely interested in the course,MUSIC 2701,1266
Roger Moseley,4,2,2,"Okay class, but not as fun as I had hoped. Possibly just because we spent more time on old and historic games that were before my era than I would have personally preferred; your experience will likely vary based on your interests. Not a ton of work, but do expect to put a bit of time in every week. Grading of the discussion posts felt quite arbitrary, and every ""satisfactory"" post is a full percentage point off your final grade, which was annoying, but the project grading felt quite generous which made up for it a bit. Overall an okay course, but in terms of video game-related courses, not the best one Cornell has to offer.",MUSIC 2701,1266

The one and only essay is worth 50%+ of your grade and the instructions don't even say that it has to be argumentative. I turned in an analytical essay and got a D. The expectations of the level/type of work to turn in was super unclear and because of that I can't say I would recommend this course even with how unique and engaging the material was,MUSIC 3490,1268

Michael Hostetler,4,1,1,"Easy class and nice overview of leadership. Can feel a bit wishy-washy, so if you want to make the most of this class then try to apply the tactics that you're learning to your life instead of just passively taking in the material. The best part of this class is the 360 degree feedback; this is where you give around 10 emails of ppl you've worked with to the organizer of the class and they send an anonymous survey to  them asking for honest feeedback from you. You then get a really detailed report with quantitative and qualitative feedback about you. that alone made this class worth it.

You learn about PHP and basic fullstack development. It kind of sucks that PHP is outdated, but I guess the logic is pretty similar. The projects can take a while though if you want to make them really nice. it really depends on how much you care.

The class covered mostly PHP and SQl but you needed to use HTML, CSS, and JS to do the assignments. There weren't any prelims or a final for the class but there was a milestone or a final submission due each week that took a decent amount of time. You could definitely take INFO 2300 without INFO 1300 as long as you are somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS but the first assignment will be painful.",NBA 5301,1276

Though it's incredibly challenging (psets typically take a minimum of 10-15 hours, and going to office hours is usually necessary), the material can be really rewarding if you put in the due time. Kleinberg's lectures were very detailed, and generally clear, though sometimes he moves too quickly/doesn't explain things simply enough. Recommendations for the course would be to a) attend every lecture/watch them on videonote, b) read the textbook before lecture and definitely before doing the psets, and c) go to office hours for *every* pset. This class probably took me at least 15 hours a week, and I felt lost on the material pretty often.

However, Professor Blume doesn't explain the concepts well; he talks for long periods of time without using visuals or pausing for questions, which makes it really difficult to follow.

We had a semester-long research project in small groups (that got adjusted during COVID) which is a large part of the class but most assignments are labs (and lab reports) and preparing for the exams (which are all short-answer questions).

Prelim averages are in the high 60s and low 70s but there are other assignments and quizzes to buffer your grade. If you start studying 2-1.5 weeks before the 3 prelims you'll do fine. Invest extra time in the information for the last prelim because it all shows up in Repro (ANSC 2400). Overall I loved the class and found the material interesting and relevant to Animal Science, and all life sciences. It's tough but definitely worth taking.",BIOAP 1100,907

Dr. Selvaraj's lectures were generally pretty dry and boring, although still informative. Dr. Allen on the other hand is a very entertaining and fun teacher. He gives a lot of hints about exam questions at reviews and in lectures which is nice as well. The quizzes, mini-exams, and prelims/final are all pretty difficult, so the averages are relatively low (around 70 for prelims and quizzes, probably higher for mini-exams because they are a bit easier).

Only thing I dislike is that a lot of your grading is dependent on your luck with getting a good TA. My TA was always looking for points to take off and sometimes would make little removals like -0.2. Even these have large consequences because of how important your section grade is. In this way, there's a large gap between those that get A-s and this that",BIOEE 1780,917

There are also short writing assignments on each organ/system unit covered, which are pretty easy to do.

The lecture wasnt all that helpful but was entertaining because of the random explosion that he would do at the end of class to illustrate some concept.

Basically, if you took AP Chem in high school and got the 5 as the class requires, you will be fine.

Sometimes it may be hard to go back and find concepts/definitions from the lectures when doing the HW, so having organized notes is really helpful.

However, they are still a good way to gauge your knowledge and digest the material. The lowest problem set grade was dropped at the end of the course, and these problem sets are why I set workload as a 4 although a 3.5 would be more appropriate. I found the problems very interesting, but they often fluctuated in difficulty, so I recommend reading through them and gauging how long it might take you to complete.

You really learn so much from nothing, and discussion is very engaging and requires you to speak, which is one of the hardest skills to practice. There is homework every day, but it helps you learn a lot and prepare for the next day. Larson Sensei if very nice and will take time to help you with whatever you need or want to talk about, and Akamatsu Sensei is very nice and does a great job teaching section and making it engaging.

Professor Hans and Rachlinski are really engaging lecturers. They call on a couple predetermined people each class so make sure you read the readings each class (these are pretty long, sometimes an entire chapter of a textbook).
